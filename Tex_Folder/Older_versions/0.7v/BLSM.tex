\chapter{B-L-SM Model} 
\label{Chap:B-L-SM_Model}

In this chapter we introduce the minimal $\U{B-L}$ gauge extension of the SM named, the B-L-SM Model \cite{Mohapatra:1980qe} and perform a numerical analysis as to measure how it can exist in light of modern measurements. This unitary group originates from the promotion of an accidental symmetry present in the SM, the Baryon number (B) minus the Lepton number (L) to a fundamental Abelian symmetry group, incidentally, also giving the model it's name. Trough this model we are capable of explaining the generation of neutrinos masses via a simple see-saw mechanism. This see-saw is enabled by the addition of three generations of right-handed heavy Majorana neutrinos that through the new field additions are possible free of anomalies. \cite{Yanagida:1979as}. Additionally, by virtue of two new physical states, specifically a new Higgs like boson $\mathrm{H}^\prime$ and a $\mathrm{Z}^\prime$ gauge boson we can also address other phenomenology, such as deviations in EW measurements, namely the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly \cite{Tanabashi2018}. The additional bosons acquire mass primarily trough the spontaneous breaking of the $\U{B-L}$ symmetry that gives its name to the model. The energy scale of this breaking will also determine the mass scale for these bosons and heavy neutrinos. This (simple) mechanism for the mass generation of the referenced bosons means the model is already very heavily constrained due to long-standing direct searches at the LHC. 

{ \color{gray} Altough a deceptively simple model it can be very appealing, given that it benefits of many deep implications. Such as the fact that, through this model we can address the metastability of the EW vacuum in the SM trough the new scalar. Allowing for Higgs stabilization up to the Plank scale with a new Higgs starting from a few hundred GeVs \cite{Degrassi:2012ry}. Metastability, simply put, is the possibility of deeper minimum than the EW VEV existing in the Higgs potential. This possibility deeply affects the formation of the early universe, especially during and after inflation making it a important question for cosmologists. Note this is yet another phenomena that the SM cannot accommodate. The B-L-SM framework is also of particular interesting in the context of the study of Grand Unified Theories (GUT) as it easily embedded into higher order symmetry groups like the $\mathrm{SO(10)}$ \cite{Chanowitz:1977ye} or $\mathrm{E}_6$ \cite{Achiman:1978vg} Lie groups. Also notable is the fact that, given the presence of a new complex singlet field, $\chi$, with a Higgs doublet typically results in enhanced strength of the EW phase transition potentially converting it into a strong first-order one. This could be detectable in the form of a gravitational wave background \cite{Barger:2008jx}. Such a analysis is of utmost importance given that it could provide a way to detect NP or exclude models without the need for a larger particle collider but instead novel gravitational waves experiments, such experiments are already planned in the form of LIGO or VIGO \cite{Abbott2020}. Furthermore, the existence of heavy neutrinos is also of cosmological significance given their presence could imply the existence of a sterile state that can play the role of Dark Matter \cite{Kaneta:2016vkq}, given that, the relatively small alteration of a, $\mathbb{Z}_2$, symmetry in the neutrino sector can make these fully sterile, as seen in Ref. \cite{Okada:2018ktp}. These neutrinos can, in such case, be used to help explain the baryon asymmetry via the leptogenesis mechanism, this scenario is discussed in depth in the following Refs.~\cite{Fukugita:1986hr}.} {\color{red} delete?} 

Recall, the B-L-SM contains a family-universal symmetry in the form of, $\mathrm{U(1)_{B-L}}$, if this symmetry was introduced without changing the SM fermion content this would lead to chiral anomalies i.e a non conservative charged current on some channels involving the $\mathrm{U(1)_{B-L}}$. These are not completely undesired by themselves, as they would allow for the presence of extra sources of $\mathcal{CP}$ violation, but this inclusion at tree-level without a suppression mechanism would lead to far too much $\mathcal{CP}$ violation. 

With this in mind, we structure this chapter in the following way. First, we present the fundamental theoretical background on the model with a strong focus on the basic details of the scalar and the gauge boson mass spectra and mixing. Followed by a modern precise study of the phenomenological status of the B-L-SM model trough a layered algorithm that will be discussed preceding the results. With this algorithm we provide a numerical analysis that tests the relevant phenomenological constraints in direct and EW observables. We table off this chapter with a few representative benchmark points. 


\section{Formulating the Model}

As alluded to previously, the minimal B-L-SM is a BSM framework containing only three new ingredients, a new gauge interaction given the new symmetry group, three generations of right handed neutrinos, and a complex scalar field $\chi$. 

The particle content and related charges of the minimal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the SM are shown in Tab \ref{tab:BLSM_Charges}. Note these are similar to the SM as to be expected. 
%

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		& $q_L$  & $u_R$ & $d_R$ & $l_L$  & $e_R$ & $\nu_R$  &  $H$  & $\chi$  \\ \hline

	\caption{Quantum fields and their respective quantum numbers in the minimal B-L-SM extension. The last two lines represent the weak and $B-L$ hypercharges}
	\label{tab:BLSM_Charges}
\end{table} 


{ \color{gray} The gauge interaction is motivated by the aforementioned GUT scenarios, while a new sector of additional three $\mathrm{U(1)_{B-L}}$ charged Majorana neutrinos is essential for anomaly cancellation and generating neutrino masses.

Note, the new scalar field, $\chi$, is solely charged under $\mathrm{U(1)_{B-L}}$. This field is solely responsible for performing the breaking of the $\mathrm{B-L}$ symmetry. This is necessarily the only way to break the symmetry given that the SM-like Higgs doublet, $H$, is does not have baryon nor lepton number. The breaking of $\chi$ happens at a larger energy scale than the EW VEV. }


\subsection{Scalar sector}

Given the information presented in Tab. \ref{tab:BLSM_Charges} we can now construct all the Lagrangian terms for this theory. Much of which would be similar to the SM - we will however focus on the novel terms. We begin our study of NP in the B-L-SM by presenting the new scalar potential, which now includes two fields and reads, 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:potential}
V(H,\chi) = \mu_1^2 H^\dagger H + \mu_2^2 \chi^\ast \chi + \lambda_1 (H^\dagger H)^2 + \lambda_2 \left(\chi^\ast \chi\right)^2 + \lambda_3  \chi^\ast \chi H^\dagger H \ , 
\end{equation}
%
where,  $\lambda_i$, the scalar couplings and $\mu_{1,2}^2$ the quadratic terms for $H$ and $\chi$ respectively. 
%
This potential must lead to a stable vacuum state, which means that the scalar potential must be bounded from below (BFB), i.e ensure a global minima. 
%
Such conditions can be deduced by evaluating this simple potential (Eq.\,(\ref{eq:potential})) derivatives and finding null conditions, these are commonly called tadpole equations. These conditions are seen in,
\begin{equation}
4 \lambda_1 \lambda_2  -  \lambda_3^2 > 0 \quad , \quad \lambda_1 , \lambda_2>0 
\label{eq:BFB} \ .
\end{equation}
%
The full components of the scalar fields $H$ and $\chi$ are given by,
\begin{equation}
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{pmatrix}
-i \( \omega_1 - i \omega_2 \) \\
v + (h + i z)
\end{pmatrix} \quad , ~\quad \chi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \( x + \(h^\prime + i z^\prime\) \) , 
\end{equation}
%
where we note that the parameters $v$ and $x$ are VEVâ€™s associated with the $H$ and the $\chi$ field, respectively.
%
In these equations we can see that $h$ and $h^\prime$ represent the radial quantum fluctuations around the minimum of the potential.
%
These will constitute the physical degrees of freedom associated with $H$ and $H^\prime$. There are also four Goldstone directions denoted as $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, $z$ and $z^\prime$ which are absorbed into longitudinal modes of the $W^\pm$, $Z$ and $Z^\prime$ gauge bosons once SSB takes place. 
%
After SSB the associated VEVs take the form, 
%
\begin{equation}
 \langle H \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
v 
\end{pmatrix} 
\quad , \quad
 \langle  \chi \rangle  = \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} \ . 
\label{eq:vacuum}
\end{equation}
% 
%here, recall $v$ and $x$ are the associated VEVs to each field. 
The tadpole equations can be solved in order to each of the VEVs, returning the following Eqs.,
%
\begin{equation}
	v^2 = \tfrac{-\lambda_2 \mu_1^2 + \tfrac{\lambda_3}{2}\mu_2^2}{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 - \tfrac{1}{4}\lambda_3^2} > 0
	\qquad
	\text{and}
	\qquad
	x^2 = \tfrac{-\lambda_1 \mu_2^2 + \tfrac{\lambda_3}{2}\mu_1^2}{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 - \tfrac{1}{4}\lambda_3^2} > 0 , 
	\label{eq:extremum}
\end{equation}
%
which, when simplified with the BFB conditions yield a simpler set of equations,
%
\begin{equation}
\lambda_2 \mu_1^2 < \tfrac{\lambda_3}{2} \mu_2^2 
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
\lambda_1 \mu_2^2 < \tfrac{\lambda_3}{2} \mu_1^2 \ . 
\label{eq:sols}
\end{equation}
%
Note that although $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ must be positive to ensure the correct conical shape of the potential, no such conditions exist for the sign of $\lambda_3$ , $\mu_1$, and $\mu_2$. However observing Eq\,(\ref{eq:sols}) we can infer that only some combinations of signs are impossible, 
%
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
			& $\mu_2^2 > 0$ & $\mu_2^2 > 0$ & $\mu_2^2 < 0$ & $\mu_2^2 < 0$  	\\
			& $\mu_1^2 > 0$ & $\mu_1^2 < 0$ & $\mu_1^2 > 0$ & $\mu_1^2 < 0$  	\\        
			\hline  
			$\lambda_3 < 0 $     			    							& 	\xmark		& \checkmark	&	\checkmark & \checkmark	\\
			$\lambda_3 > 0$     			    							& \xmark		& \xmark	&	\xmark &  \checkmark \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular} 
		\caption{Possible signs of the potential parameters in Eq\,(\ref{eq:potential}). 
The \checkmark\,symbol indicates the existence of solutions for tadpole conditions Eq.\,\eqref{eq:sols}, while the \xmark\,indicates unstable configurations.}
		\label{tab:signs}  
	\end{center}
\end{table} 
%
For our numerical analysis we decided to leave the sign of $\lambda_3$ positive, choosing a configuration where both $\mu$ parameters are negative. 
%
This does not directly translate to any real physical consequence.  

With these conditions now established we proceed to investigate the physical states of the B-L-SM scalar sector. 
%
At the vacuum, we evaluate the Hessian matrix as,
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}^2 =
\begin{pmatrix}
4 \lambda_2 x^2 & \lambda_3 v x \\ 
\lambda_3 v x   & 4 \lambda_1 v^2 
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\label{eq:hess}
\end{equation}
% 
Moving this matrix to its physical mass eigenbase, we obtain the following eigenvalues,
%
\begin{equation}
m_{h_{1,2}}^2 = \lambda_1 v^2 + \lambda_2 x^2 \mp \sqrt{(\lambda_1 v^2 - \lambda_2 x^2)^2 + (\lambda_3 x v)^2}.
\label{eq:eigvals}
\end{equation}
The physical basis vectors $h_1$ and $h_2$ can then be related to the original fields of gauge eigenbasis $h$ and $h^\prime$ trough a simple rotation matrix:
%
\begin{equation}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	h_1 \\
	h_2 
	\end{pmatrix}
	=
	\mathbf{O}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	h \\
	h^\prime 
	\end{pmatrix},
	\label{eq:trans}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{O}$ can be parameterized by a single mixing angle $\alpha_h$,
%
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{O} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\cos \alpha_h & -\sin \alpha_h \\
	\sin \alpha_h & \cos \alpha_h 
	\end{pmatrix}\,.
	\label{eq:rotmat}
\end{equation}
%
%The precise mixing angle is represented simply by, 
%\begin{equation}
%\tan 2 \alpha_h   = \frac{ \left| \lambda_3 \right|  v x }{  \lambda_2 x^2 -\lambda_1 v^2 } 
%\end{equation} 
%
It is particularly interesting to analyze the scenario where the scalar fields approximately decouple, that is, in the limit, $v/x\ll 1$. In these circumstances, the scalar masses and the mixing angle become rather simple,
\begin{equation}
\sin \alpha_h \approx \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\lambda_3}{\lambda_2} \dfrac{v}{x} \quad , \quad 
m_{h_1}^2 \approx 2 \lambda_1 v^2 \quad , \quad m_{h_2}^2 \approx 2 \lambda_2 x^2
\label{eq:simplify} .
\end{equation}
%
We will see in the context of our numerical results that for a phenomenologically consistent mass scale these equations serve as a valid approximation for most of the points. 

\subsection{Gauge Sector}

Moving onto the gauge boson and Higgs kinetic terms in the B-L-SM, consider the following portion of the Lagrangian,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{U(1)'s}} =  \left| D_\mu H \right|^2 + \left| D_\mu \chi \right|^2 -\dfrac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} -\dfrac{1}{4} F^\prime_{\mu \nu} F^{\prime \mu \nu} -\dfrac{1}{2} \kappa F_{\mu \nu} F^{\prime \mu \nu} , 
\label{eq:Lu1}
\end{equation}
where $F^{\mu \nu}$ and $F^{\prime \mu \nu}$ are the standard field strength tensors, respectively for the $\U{Y}$ and  $\U{B-L}$ Abelian groups, 
\begin{equation}
	F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu 
	\qquad
	\text{and}
	\qquad
	 F^\prime_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A^\prime_\nu - \partial_\nu A^\prime_\mu\,,
	 \label{eq:Fmn}
\end{equation}
written in terms of the gauge fields $A_\mu$ and $A_\mu^\prime$, respectively. Given that this is a model with two Unitary groups, without a parity symmetry ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) to prevent it, we must consider the possible mixing in between them. In this work we parameterized this mixing trough a parameter $\kappa$.

With this goal in mind consider the Abelian portion of the covariant derivative in Eq.\,(\ref{eq:Lu1}) is given by,
\begin{equation}
	D_\mu \supset i g_1 Y A_\mu + i g_1^\prime Y_{\rm B-L} A_\mu^\prime\,,
\end{equation} 
% 
with $g_1$ and $g_1^\prime$ the $\U{Y}$ and $\U{B-L}$ the gauge couplings with the $Y$ and $B-L$ charges are specified in Tab.{tab:BLSM_Charges}. It is convenient to rewrite the gauge kinetic terms in the canonical form, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
	F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} + F^\prime_{\mu \nu} F^{\prime \mu \nu} + 2 \kappa F_{\mu \nu} F^{\prime \mu \nu} \to B_{\mu \nu} B^{\mu \nu} + B^\prime_{\mu \nu} B^{\prime \mu \nu}\,.
	\label{eq:AtoB}
\end{equation}
%
A generic orthogonal transformation in the field space does not eliminate the kinetic mixing term. So, in order to satisfy Eq.~\eqref{eq:AtoB} an extra non-orthogonal transformation should be imposed such that Eq.~\eqref{eq:AtoB} is realized. Taking $\kappa = \sin \alpha$, a suitable redefinition of fields $\{A_\mu,A_\mu^\prime\}$ into $\{B_\mu, B_\mu^\prime\}$ that eliminates $\kappa$-term according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:Lu1} can be cast as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	A_\mu \\
	A^\prime_\mu 
	\end{pmatrix}
	=
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 & -\tan \alpha \\
	0 & \sec \alpha 
	\end{pmatrix}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	B_\mu \\
	B^\prime_\mu 
	\end{pmatrix}\,.
	\label{eq:trans-kappa}
\end{equation}
Note there is a limit without kinetic mixing where $\alpha = 0$. Note that this transformation is generic and valid for any basis in the field space. The transformation (\ref{eq:trans-kappa}) results in a modification of the covariant derivative that acquires two additional terms encoding the details of the kinetic mixing, i.e.

\begin{equation}
D_\mu \supset \partial_\mu + i \(g_Y \; Y + g_BY \; Y_{B-L}\) B_\mu + i \(g_{B-L} \; Y_{B-L} + g_{YB} \; Y\) B_\mu^\prime\,,
\label{eq:newCov}
\end{equation}	
where the gauge couplings take the form
\begin{equation}
	g_Y = g_1 \quad , \quad 
	g_{B-L} = g_1^\prime \sec \alpha   \quad , \quad 
	g_{YB} = -g_1 \tan \alpha  \quad , \quad 
	g_{BY} = 0 \,,  
	\label{eq:new-g-simp}
\end{equation}
%
which is the standard convention in the literature.
%
Note that this definition is merely to simplify the equations and has no physical impact. 
%
We will later see that this kinetic mixing is a desired feature and why stabilizing it with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry would be detrimental in terms of depth.
%
The resulting mixing between the neutral gauge fields including $Z^\prime$ can be represented as follows
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_\mu \\
Z_\mu \\
Z^\prime_\mu
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta_W & \sin \theta_W & 0\\
-\sin \theta_W \cos \theta_W^\prime & \cos \theta_W \cos \theta_W^\prime & \sin \theta_W^\prime \\
\sin \theta_W \sin \theta_W^\prime & -\cos \theta_W^\prime \sin \theta_W^\prime & \cos \theta_W^\prime
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
B_\mu \\
A^3_\mu \\
B^\prime_\mu
\end{pmatrix} , 
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:g-Z-Zp}
\end{equation}
%
where $\theta_W$ is the weak mixing angle and $\theta^\prime_W$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\sin(2 \theta^\prime_W) = \frac{2 g_{YB} \sqrt{g^2 + g_{Y}^2}}{\sqrt{(g_{YB}^2 + 16 (\frac{x}{v})^2 g_{B-L}^2 - g^2 - g_{Y}^2)^2 + 4 g_{YB}^2 (g^2 + g_{Y}^2)} }\,,
\label{eq:theta-p-full}
\end{equation}
%
in terms of $g$ and $g_{Y}$ being the $\mathrm{SU(2)_{L}}$ and $\mathrm{U_{Y}}$ gauge couplings, respectively. In the physically relevant limit, $v/x \ll 1$, the above expression greatly simplifies leading to
%
\begin{equation}
	\sin \theta_W^\prime \approx \dfrac{1}{16
	} \dfrac{g_{YB}}{g_{B-L}}\( \dfrac{v}{x} \)^2 \sqrt{g^2 + g_{Y}^2} \,,
	\label{eq:theta-p}
\end{equation}
%
up to $(v/x)^3$ corrections. In the limit of no kinetic mixing, i.e. $g_{YB} \to 0$, there is no mixture of $Z^\prime$ and SM gauge bosons. 

Note, that the kinetic mixing parameter $\theta_W^\prime$ has rather stringent constraints from $Z$ pole experiments both at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) and the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC), restricting its value to be smaller than $10^{-3}$ approximately \cite{Bandyopadhyay_2018}, which we set as an upper bound in our numerical analysis. 

Finally we can, trough the expansion of the kinetic terms $\left| D_\mu H \right|^2 + \left| D_\mu \chi \right|^2$ around the vacuum, extract the following mass matrix for the vector bosons
\begin{equation}
	m_V^2 =
	\dfrac{v^2}{4}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	g^2 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \\
	0 \;\;&\;\; g^2 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \\
	0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; g^2 \;\;&\;\; -g g_{Y} \;\;&\;\; -g g_{YB} \\
	0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; -g g_{Y} \;\;&\;\; g_{Y}^2 \;\;&\;\; g_{Y} g_{YB} \\
	0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; -g g_{YB} \;\;&\;\; g_{Y} g_{YB} \;\;&\;\; g_{YB}^2 + 16 \(\dfrac{x}{v}\)^2 g_{B-L}^2
	\end{pmatrix} , 
\end{equation}
%
whose, first set of eigenvalues read,
\begin{equation}
	m_A = 0 \quad \text{,} \quad m_W = \tfrac{1}{2} v g \ , 
\end{equation}
corresponding to the expected physical photon and $W^\pm$ bosons. While the following set,
\begin{equation}
m_{Z,Z^\prime}=\sqrt{g^2 + g^2_{Y}} \cdot \frac{v}{2}  \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{g_{YB}^2 + 16 (\frac{x}{v})^2 g^2_{\rm BL} }{g^2 + g^2_{\rm Y}} +1  \right) \mp \frac{g_{YB}}{\sin(2 \theta_W^\prime) \sqrt{g^2 + g^2_{\rm Y}}}}\,,
\label{eq:ZZp-mass}
\end{equation}
correspond to two neutral massive vector bosons, with one of them, not necessarily the lightest, representing the SM-like $Z$ boson. It follows from LEP and SLC constraints on $\theta_W^\prime$, that Eq.~\eqref{eq:theta-p} also implies that either $g_{YB}$ or the ratio ${v}/{x}$ are small. In this limit, Eq.~\eqref{eq:ZZp-mass} simplifies to
\begin{equation}
	m_Z \approx \tfrac{1}{2} v \sqrt{g^2 + g_{Y}^2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad m_{Z^\prime} \approx 2 g_{B-L} x\,,
	\label{eq:mZ}
\end{equation}
%
where the $m_{Z^\prime}$ depends only on the SM-singlet VEV ,$x$ and on the $\mathrm{U(1)_{B-L}}$ gauge coupling and will be attributed to a heavy $Z^\prime$ state, while the light $Z$-boson mass corresponds to its SM value.

\subsection{The Yukawa Sector}

One of the key features of the B-L-SM model is the presence of non-zero neutrino masses. 
%
In its minimal version, such masses are generated via a type-I seesaw mechanism, thus producing a very light neutrino for each of the three known flavors, and a corresponding heavy neutrino one for each, which we theorize are yet to be observed.
%
In the type-I seesaw mechanism the mixing of neutrinos fields is written with similar shape to, 
\begin{equation}
\left( \begin{array}{c|c}
0 & A \\
\midrule
A & B 
\end{array} \right) . 
\end{equation}
This system would have a set eigenvalues written as, 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\pm = \frac{ B \pm \sqrt{B^2 + 4 A} }{ 2 } \ . 
\end{equation}
Investigating the nature of these eigenvalues allows us to understand the see-saw process.
%
The mean of these values being always equal to $|B|$, if one value goes up, another goes down, like a see-saw. $B$ is set to be proportional to Majorana mass terms, orders of magnitude higher than the cross-terms $A$. Given this, the smaller eigenvalue, is, 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_- \approx \frac{A^2}{B} . 
\end{equation}
This mechanism serves to explain why the neutrino masses are so small if there exists a much heavier partner in the see-saw. 

The total Yukawa Lagrangian of the model reads,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_f = 
-Y_u^{ij} \bar{q}_{\rm L i} u_{\rm R j} \widetilde{H} 
-Y_d^{ij} \bar{q}_{\rm L i} d_{\rm R j} H
-Y_e^{ij} \bar{\ell}_{\rm L i} e_{\rm R j} H
- Y_\nu^{ij} \bar{\ell}_{\rm L i} \nu_{\rm R j} \widetilde{H}
	-\dfrac{1}{2} Y_\chi^{ij} \overline{\nu}_{\rm R i}^c \nu_{\rm R j} \chi + {\rm H.c.} \ . 
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:Yuk}
\end{equation}
%
Notice the explicit lack of Majorana neutrino mass terms of the form $M \overline{\nu_{R}^c} \nu_{R}$. 
These explicitly violate the $\mathrm{U(1)_{B-L}}$ symmetry and are therefore not present. 
In Eq.~\eqref{eq:Yuk}, $Y_u$, $Y_d$ and $Y_e$ are the $3 \times 3$ Yukawa matrices that reproduce the quark and charged lepton sector exactly the same way as in the SM, while $Y_\nu$ and $Y_\chi$ are the new Yukawa matrices responsible for the generation of right handed neutrino masses and mixing with left handed fields.
%
In particular, one can write,
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{m}_{\nu_l}^{\text{Type-I}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\dfrac{v^2}{x} \mathbf{Y}_\nu^t \mathbf{Y}^{-1}_\chi \mathbf{Y}_\nu\,,
\end{equation}
%
for light $\nu_l$ neutrino masses, whereas the heavy $\nu_h$ ones are given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{m}_{\nu_h}^{\text{Type-I}} \approx \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{Y}_\chi x\,,
\end{equation} 
where we have assumed a flavor diagonal basis.

Note that the smallness of light neutrino masses imply that either the $x$ VEV is very large or (if we fix it to be at the $\mathcal{O}\left({\mathrm{TeV}}\right)$ scale and $\mathbf{Y}_\chi \sim \mathcal{O}\(1\right)$) the corresponding Yukawa coupling should be tiny, $\mathbf{Y}_\nu < 10^{-6}$. 
%
It is clear that the low scale character of the type-I seesaw mechanism in the minimal B-L-SM is \textit{faked} by small Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson. A more elegant description was proposed in Ref.~\cite{Khalil:2010iu} where small SM neutrino masses naturally result from an inverse seesaw mechanism.
%
In this work, however, we will not study the neutrino sector and thus, for an improved efficiency of our numerical analysis of $Z^\prime$ observables, it will be sufficient to fix the Yukawa couplings to $\mathbf{Y}_\chi = 10^{-1}$ and $\mathbf{Y}_\nu = 10^{-7}$ values such that the three lightest neutrinos lie in the sub-eV domain.


\section{Numerical Results}

Given the nature of this model, much work has already been performed on it. We would then like to point-out the recent work done by our colleges in Ref. \cite{Deppisch:2019ldi}. Where a comprehensive study for the $Z^\prime$ at the LHC is performed, in particular, from $0.2 \ \mathrm{GeV}$ to $200 \ \mathrm{GeV}$. As for slightly heavier $Z^\prime$ masses beyond $m_{Z^\prime} \gtrsim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$, the combined effect of the EW precision observables and the ATLAS searches for Drell-Yan $Z^\prime$ production decaying into di-leptons, i.e.~$pp \to Z^\prime \to ee,\mu \mu$ \cite{Aaboud:2017buh}, is also finely investigated. We then endeavored to achieve a complementary study where we investigated the case of very heavy $Z^\prime$ bosons. 

Our goal is to see if the case of an heavy $Z^\prime$, whose kinect mixing is highly constrained by LHC experimental results, can provide additional phenomenological implications besides the addition of a new unobserved vector boson trough this portal. This was chiefly done by the investigation of the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly. We examine the relations that this anomaly has with the parameter space, such as gauge couplings, as well as the extra scalar mass. 

%\subsubsection{The $\left( g-2 \right)_\mu$ anomaly refers}

The $\left( g-2 \right)_\mu$ anomaly refers to the discrepancy between the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\mathrm{\text{exp}}} \equiv \tfrac{1}{2} \left( g-2 \right)^{\mathrm{\text{exp}}}_\mu$, and its theoretical prediction, $a_\mu^{\mathrm{SM}} \equiv \tfrac{1}{2} \left(g-2\right)^{\mathrm{SM}}_\mu$, which reads \cite{Tanabashi:2018oca}
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{g-2}
	\Delta a_\mu = a_\mu^{\ro{exp}} - a_\mu^{\ro{SM}} = 268(63)(43) \times 10^{-11}
\end{equation}
%
with numbers in brackets denoting experimental and theoretical errors, respectively. This represents a deviations of $3.5$ standard deviations from the combined $1 \sigma$ error and is calling for new physics effects beyond the SM theory. 

There is a strong possibility that through radiative corrections a new gauge bosons could explain this deviation \cite{Czarnecki:2001pv}. In fact a version of this study has already been performed in the supersymmetrical version of the B-L-SM \cite{Yang:2018guw}. 

In the B-L-SM, NP contributions to $a_\mu$, denoted as $\Delta a_\mu^{\textrm{NP}}$ in what follows, can emerge from the diagrams containing $Z^\prime$ or $h_2$ propagators. New physics contributions $\Delta a_\mu^{\ro{NP}}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment are given at one-loop order by the Feynman diagrams depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:g-2}.

\subsection{The Scanning Apparatus}

The numerical data presented in this section was generated via a large chain of nested scripts. These were created as a first generation of a scanning framework for generic phenomenological models. This machinery later expanded and improved for the 3HDM portion of the thesis, so much of this introduction will be glossed over in the 3HDM section, as much remained the same. 

The underlying code is a mixture of Linux bash and Python 3 scripts, and utilizes \texttt{SPheno 4.0.3} \cite{Porod:2011nf},  \texttt{SARAH 4.13.0} \cite{Staub:2013tta}, \texttt{HiggsBounds 4.3.1} \cite{Bechtle:2013wla}, \texttt{HiggsSignals 1.4.0} \cite{Bechtle:2013xfa} and \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO 2.6.2} \cite{Alwall:2014hca} programs/packages. 

These scripts generate a Monte-Carlo type scan through a desired parameter space. Unless introduced, all non-relevant physical constants and parameters are defined in a way as to keep the observed gauge, lepton and quark structure. { \color{gray} Skipping a bit ahead, as an example, for the B-L-SM scan our routine randomly samples parameter space points according to the ranges in Tab.~\ref{tab:scan} while keeping things like Higgs doublet VEV and Weinberg angle to reproduce the correct $W$ and $Z$ structure. } 

Given the randomness in our scan, we can reach nonphysical, or nonsensical regions, that contain objects like tachyonic scalar masses un-renormalizable quantities, divergent radiative corrections etc. 
%
These points must be rejected before even considering experimental constraints. This is done by automatically by a prepackaged setting in \texttt{SPheno}. 
%
We could consider this our first layered check. 

While a second layer of tests include the phenomenological studies we shall perform. 
%
This is the region where we confront the surviving scenarios with experimental data. 
%
Such as precision measurements from the oblique $S,T,U$ parameters and constraining the Higgs Sector to reproduce the observed signal seen in the LHC in 2012. 
%
The latter is made automatically trough the package \texttt{HiggsBounds 4.3.1} that shall be used to apply a $95\%$ C.L. exclusion limit cut on a new scalar particle, $h_2$, while \texttt{HiggsSignals 1.4.0} is used to calculate and later check, through a $\chi^2$ distribution, the probability for consistency with the observed Higgs boson signal data. 
% 
To calculate these variables \texttt{HiggsBounds 4.3.1} and \texttt{HiggsSignals 1.4.0} are provided all scalar masses, total decay widths, Higgs decay branching ratios as well as the SM-normalized effective Higgs couplings to fermions and bosons squared (that are needed for analysis of the Higgs boson production cross sections). For details about this calculation, see Ref.~\cite{Bechtle:2013wla}.

{ \color{gray} After setting a random set of parameters \texttt{SPheno} will generate all relevant data for our analysis if possible. \texttt{SPheno} is a particle spectrum generator code written in Fortran 90. Its emphasis on easy generalisability and speed made it a natural part of our numerical analysis. It takes information about our models Lagrangian, such as fields, charges and fundamental symmetries, and creates a executable file capable of quickly generating a spectrum file with all details regarding mass, decay and flavour observables information in the standardized SUSY Les-Houches accord format. All generated spectrums are processed and stored. 
%
This Lagrangian information is fed to \texttt{SPheno} also in standardized format automatically generated by a Mathematica packaged designed for such purposes called \texttt{SARAH}. }

On a third and final layer of phenomenological tests we have studied the viability of the surviving scenarios from the perspective of direct collider searches for a new $Z^\prime$ gauge boson. 
%
We have used, the popular \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, to compute the $Z^\prime$ Drell-Yan production cross section and subsequent decay into the first and second-generation leptons, i.e.~$ \sigma\left(pp \to Z^\prime\right) \times B\left(Z^\prime \to \ell \ell\right)$ with $\ell = e,\; \mu$, and then compare our results to the most recent ATLAS exclusion bounds from the LHC runs at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13~\ro{TeV}$ \cite{Aaboud:2017buh}. 
%
The \texttt{SPheno} SLHA output files were used as parameter cards for \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, where the information required to calculate $ \sigma\left(pp \to Z^\prime\right) \times B\left(Z^\prime \to \ell \ell\right)$, such as the $Z^\prime$ boson mass, its total width and decay branching ratios into lepton pairs, is provided. 
%
The lepton anomalous magnetic moments $\left( g-2 \right)_\ell /2 \equiv a_\ell$ are calculated in \texttt{SPheno} at one-loop order. Note, despite these diagrams being one-loop order all masses are calculated at 2-loop order in \texttt{SPheno}.  


\subsection{Numerical discussion}

For the B-L-SM scan our routine randomly samples parameter space points according to the ranges in Tab.~\ref{tab:scan}.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Electroweak Precision Observables}
\label{Sec:B-L-SM-EW}
Typically, the most stringent constraints of the scalar sector emerge from the oblique $S,T,U$ parameters, which are also calculated by \texttt{SPheno}. 
%
This conecept was first introduced by Peskin and T. Takeuchi in Ref\,\cite{Peskin1992}.
%
Current precision measurements provide the allowed regions,
%
\begin{equation}
	S = 0.02 \pm 0.10\,, \qquad T = 0.07 \pm 0.12\,, \qquad U = 0.00 \pm 0.09 \ ,
	\label{eq:oblique}
\end{equation}
%
where $S$-$T$ are $92\%$ correlated, while $S$-$U$ and $T$-$U$ are $-66\%$ and $-86\%$ anti-correlated, respectively.
%
We compare our results with the EW fit in Eq.~\eqref{eq:oblique} and require consistency with the best fit point within a $95\%$ C.L.~ellipsoid (see Ref.~\cite{Costa:2014qga} for further details about this method). %
%
The contributions coming from NP can be calculated trough,
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta \chi \equiv \sum_{ij}  \left(  \Delta \mathcal{O}_{i}^{NP} - \mathcal{O}_{i}^{(0)} \right) [ ( \sigma^2 )^{-1} ]_{ij}  \left(  \mathcal{O}_{j}^{NP} - \mathcal{O}_{j}^{(0)}  \right) < 7.815 \ , 
\end{equation}
%
where $\Delta \mathcal{O}_i^{NP} \equiv \mathcal{O}_i - \mathcal{O}^{SM} \rightarrow (\Delta S , \Delta T , \Delta U )$ and $\mathcal{O}_i^{(0)}$ is the deviation generated by the Higgs doublet in the SM if his mass is 125.09. Finally the covariance matrix expressed in terms of correlation matrix and started deviations can be seen in, 
\begin{equation}
[ \sigma^2 ]^{-1} \equiv \begin{pmatrix}
867.49 & âˆ’904.30 & -360.66\\
âˆ’904.30 & 1154.65 & 584.55 \\
âˆ’360.66 & 584.55 &  455.19
\end{pmatrix} . 
\end{equation}
These values are taken from \cite{Baak_2012}. 

We show in Fig.~\ref{fig:STU} our results in the $ST$ (left) and $TU$ (right) planes where black points are consistent with EW precision observables at $95\%$ C.L.~whereas grey ones lie outside the corresponding ellipsoid of the best fit point and, thus, the first points to be excluded in our analysis.

\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%The B-L-SM predicts a new visible scalar, which we denote as $h_2$, in addition to a SM-like $125~\ro{GeV}$ Higgs boson, $h_1$. 

\subsubsection{Higgs Constraints}

We then confront the surviving scenarios (black points in Fig.~\ref{fig:STU}), with collider bounds on Higgs searches at the LHC, LEP and the Tevatron trough \texttt{HiggsBounds 4.3.1} and \texttt{HiggsSignals 1.4.0}. 
%
Additionally we also ensured that a SM Higgs candidate is assured, $m_{h_1} = 125.10 \pm 0.14~\textrm{GeV}$. 

%The basic value calculated by \texttt{HiggsSignals} is the signal strength modifier $\mu_{x}$ which parameterizes the signal rate of a particular final state $x$ normalized to the SM expectation trougha a peak-centered $\chi^2$ statistical method.

%The combined implementation of \texttt{HiggsBounds/HiggsSignals}, looks at the properties of the discovered Higgs and searches for additional Higgs states, which are then either excluded or allowed in the particle spectra of our model. 

\subsubsection{$Z^\prime$ Constraints}

Trough the previously mentioned process we can now look at the viability of the surviving points from the perspective of direct collider searches for a new $Z^\prime$ gauge boson. Enabling the discussion of the phenomenological properties of the B-L-SM model. We can see the impact of all layered cuts in the following figures reflecting Higgs and Gauge physics cuts. We show in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} the scenarios generated in our parameter space scan that have passed all theoretical and experimental.
%

Coloured points have survived all theoretical and experimental constraints while grey points are excluded by direct $Z^\prime$ searches at the LHC. The region between the two dashed lines represents the current ATLAS expected limit on the production cross section times branching ratio into a pair of leptons at $95\%$ C.L.~and is taken from the plot in Fig.~4 of Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2017buh}. The four highlighted points in both panels denote the benchmark scenarios described in detail in Tab.~\ref{tab:bench}.}
	\label{fig:Plots1}
\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Here, on the left panel, we show the $Z^\prime$ production cross section times its branching ratio to the first - and second-generation leptons, $\sigma B \equiv \sigma \left( pp \to Z^\prime \right) \times B \left( Z^\prime \to \ell \ell \right) $ with $\ell = e,\mu$, as a function of the new vector boson mass and the new physics contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $\Delta a^{\textrm{NP}}_\mu$ (color scale). 
%
On the right panel, we show the new scalar mass, $m_{h_2}$, as a function of the $Z^\prime$ Mass. 
%
All points above the red dashed line are excluded at $95\%$ C.L.~by the upper expected limit on $Z^\prime$ direct searches at the LHC by the ATLAS experiment and are represented in gray shades. 
%
Darker shades denote \textit{would-be-scenarios} with larger values of $\Delta a^{\textrm{NP}}_\mu$ while the smaller contributions to the muon $\left(g-2\right)_\mu / 2$ anomaly are represented with the lighter shades. 
%
The region between the two dashed lines corresponds to the $Z^\prime$ ATLAS limit with a $2\sigma$ uncertainty represented by the yellow band in Fig.~4 of \cite{Aaboud:2017buh}.
%
Provided that the observed limit by the ATLAS detector lies within this region we have taken a conservative approach and accepted all points whose $\sigma B$ value lies below the red dashed line (upper limit) in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1}.
%
The blue dashed line, which corresponds to the stricter $2 \sigma$ lower bound, is only shown for completeness of information. The red cross in our figures signals the lightest $Z^\prime$ found in our scan which we regard as a possible early-discovery (or early-exclusion) benchmark point in the forthcoming LHC runs. Such a benchmark point is shown in the first line of Tab.~\ref{tab:bench}.
%
On the right panel, we notice that the new scalar bosons can become as light as $380 - 400~\textrm{GeV}$, but with $Z^\prime$ masses in the range of $5 - 9~\textrm{TeV}$. We highlight with a magenta diamond the benchmark point with the lightest $Z^\prime$ boson within this range. 
%
This point is shown in the second line of Tab.~\ref{tab:bench}.

\subsubsection{Implications of direct $Z^\prime$ searches at the LHC for the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly}

Looking again to Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} (left panel), we see that there is a thin dark-red stripe where $\Delta a^{\ro{NP}}_\mu$ explains the observed anomaly shown in Eq.~(\ref{g-2}) for a range of $m_{Z^\prime}$ boson masses approximately between $5~\ro{TeV}$ and $20~\ro{TeV}$. This region is particularly interesting as it can be partially probed by the forthcoming LHC runs or at future colliders. If a $Z^\prime$ boson discovery remains elusive for such a mass range, it can exclude a possibility of explaining the muon $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly in the context of the B-L-SM. It is also worth noticing that such preferred $\Delta a^{\ro{NP}}_\mu$ values represent a small island in the right plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} where the new scalar boson mass is restricted to the range of $1~\ro{TeV} < m_{h_2} < 4~\ro{TeV}$.

Since the couplings of a new scalar $h_2$ to the SM fermions are suppressed by a factor of $\sin \alpha_h$, which we find to be always smaller than $0.08$ as can be seen in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4}, the right diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:g-2}, which scales as $\Delta a_\mu^{h_2} \propto {m_\mu^2}/{m_{h_2}^2}\left(y_\mu \sin \alpha_h\right)^2$ with $\sin^2 \alpha_h < 0.0064$ and $y_\mu = Y_e^{22}$, providing sub-leading contributions to $\Delta a_{\mu}$. Furthermore, as we show in the top-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4} the new scalar boson mass, which we have found to satisfy $m_{h_2} \gtrsim 380~\ro{GeV}$, is not light enough to compensate the smallness of the scalar mixing angle.

\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Conversely,  the new $Z^\prime$ boson can have sizeable couplings to fermions via gauge interactions proportional to $g_{\rm B-L}$. Therefore, the left diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:g-2} provides the leading contribution to the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ in the model under consideration. The $\Delta a_\mu^{Z^\prime}$ contribution coming from the $Z^\prime$ is given by \cite{Freitas:2014pua}
\begin{equation}
\Delta a_\mu^{Z^\prime} = \tfrac{1}{12 \pi^2} \tfrac{m_{\mu}^2}{m_{Z^\prime}^2} \(3 g_{\rm L}^{\mu \mu Z^\prime} g_{\rm R}^{\mu \mu Z^\prime} - {g_{\rm L}^{\mu \mu Z^\prime}}^2 - {g_{\rm R}^{\mu \mu Z^\prime}}^2 \) ,
\label{eq:ZpContribution}
\end{equation}
where the left- and right-chiral projections of the charged lepton couplings to the $Z^\prime$ boson, $g_{\rm L}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime}$ and $g_{\rm R}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime}$, respectively, can be approximated as follows,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    g_{\rm L}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime} &\simeq g_{\rm B-L} + \tfrac{1}{32} \(\tfrac{v}{x}\)^2 \tfrac{g_{\rm YB}}{g_{\rm B-L}} \[g_{\rm Y}^2 - g^2 + 2 g_{\rm Y}g_{\rm YB}\]\,,
    \\
    g_{\rm R}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime} &\simeq g_{\rm B-L} + \tfrac{1}{16} \(\tfrac{v}{x}\)^2 \tfrac{g_{\rm YB}}{g_{\rm B-L}} \[g_{\rm Y}^2 + g_{\rm Y}g_{\rm YB}\]\,,
\end{aligned}\label{eq:gllZ}
\end{equation}
to second order in $v/x$-expansion. If $v/x \ll 1$, corresponding to the darker shades of the color scale in the top-right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4}, we can further approximate
%
\begin{equation}
    g_{\rm L}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime} \simeq g_{\rm R}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime} \simeq g_{\ro{B-L}}\,,
    \label{eq:gLgR-simp}
\end{equation}
%
such that the muon anomalous magnetic moment gets significantly simplified to
\begin{equation}
\Delta a_\mu^{Z^\prime} \simeq \dfrac{g_{\ro{B-L}}^2}{12 \pi^2} \dfrac{m_{\mu}^2}{m_{Z^\prime}^2}\,.
\label{eq:amu-simple}
\end{equation}
%
Similarly, for the yellow band in the bottom of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3}, which corresponds to the region where $\Delta a_{\mu}^{\rm NP}$ is maximized (see top-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1}), a large value of the $\U{B-L}$ gauge coupling also allows one to simplify Eq.~\eqref{eq:ZpContribution} reducing it to the form of Eq.~\eqref{eq:amu-simple}. This is in fact what we have observed and, for the yellow band region, we see in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3} that $g_{\ro{B-L}} \simeq 3$. A sizeable value of $g_{\ro{B-L}}$ is indeed what is contributing to the enhancement of $\Delta a_{\mu}^{\rm NP}$, in particular, for the red region in both panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1}. We show in the third and fourth lines of Tab.~\ref{tab:bench} the two benchmark points that better reproduce the muon anomalous magnetic moment represented by two black dots in
Figs.~\ref{fig:Plots1}, \ref{fig:Plots4} to \ref{fig:Plots2}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In fact, a close inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} (left panel) and Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4} (top-right panel) reveals an almost one-to-one correspondence between the colour shades. 
This suggests that $\Delta a_{\mu}^{Z^\prime}$ must somehow be related to the VEV ratio $v/x$. 
To understand this behaviour, let us also look to Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3} (top-left panel) where we see that the kinetic-mixing gauge coupling $g_{\ro{YB}}$ is typically very small apart from two green bands where it can become of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
Interestingly, whenever $g_{\ro{YB}}$ becomes sizeable, $v/x \ll 1$ is realised, which means that Eq.~\eqref{eq:mZ} is indeed a good approximation as was argued above. It is then possible to eliminate $g_{\ro{B-L}}$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:amu-simple} and rewrite it as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta a_\mu^{Z^\prime} \simeq \dfrac{y_\mu^2}{96 \pi^2} \(\dfrac{v}{x}\)^2 \,,
    \label{eq:amu-vev}
\end{equation}
which explains the observed correlation between both Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} (left panel) and Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4} (top-right panel) and, for instance, the thin red stripe of points is compatible with a full description of the muon $\left(g-2\right)_{\mu}/2$ anomaly. Note that this simple and illuminating relation becomes valid as a consequence of the heavy $Z^\prime$ mass regime, in combination with the smallness of the $\theta_{W}^{\prime}$ mixing angle required by LEP constraints. Indeed, while we have not imposed any strong restriction on the input parameters of our scan (see Tab.~\ref{tab:scan}), Eq.~\eqref{eq:theta-p} necessarily implies that both $g_{\ro{YB}}$ and $v/x$ cannot be simultaneously sizeable in agreement with what is seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3} (top-left panel) and Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4} (top-right panel). The values of $\theta_W^\prime$ obtained in our scan are shown in the top-right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3}.

For completeness, we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots2} the physical couplings of $Z^\prime$ to muons (top panels) and to $W^\pm$ bosons (bottom panel).

Note that, for the considered scenarios, the latter can be written as
\begin{equation}
    g^{WWZ^\prime} \simeq \dfrac{1}{16} \dfrac{g_{\ro{YB}}}{g_{\ro{B-L}}} \(\dfrac{v}{x}\)^2\,.
    \label{eq:gWWZp}
\end{equation}
While both $g_{\ro{B-L}}$ and the ratio $v/x$ provide a smooth continuous contribution in the $\sigma B - m_{Z^\prime}$ projection of the parameter space, the observed blurry region in $g^{WWZ^\prime}$ is correlated with the one in the top-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3} as expected from Eq.~\eqref{eq:gWWZp}. On the other hand, the couplings to leptons $g_{\rm L,R}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime}$ exhibit a strong correlation with $g_{\ro{B-L}}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3}, in agreement with our discussion above and with Eq.~\eqref{eq:gLgR-simp}. }

\subsection{Barr-Zee type contributions}
\label{sec:BarrZee}

To conclude our analysis, one should note that the two-loop Barr-Zee type diagrams \cite{Barr:1990vd} are always sub-dominant in our case given, that they were not taken into account in the previous calculations. To see this, let us consider the four diagrams shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Barr-Zee}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{/BLSM/Barr-Zee.pdf}

\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The same reason that suppresses the one-loop $h_2$ contribution in Fig.~\ref{fig:g-2} is also responsible for the suppression of both the top-right and bottom-right diagrams in Fig.~\ref{fig:Barr-Zee} (for details see e.g.~Ref.~\cite{Ilisie:2015tra}). Recall that the coupling of $h_2$ to the SM particles is proportional to the scalar mixing angle $\alpha_h$, which is always small (or very small) as we can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4}. An analogous effect is present in the diagram involving a $W$-loop, where a vertex proportional to $g^{WWZ^\prime}$ suppresses such a contribution. The only diagram that might play a sizeable role is the top-left one where the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to both muons and top quarks are not negligible.

{ \color{gray}
Let us then estimate the size of the first diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:Barr-Zee}. This type of diagrams were already calculated in Ref.~\cite{Feng:2009gn} but for the case of a SM $Z$-boson. Since the same topology holds for the considered case of B-L-SM too, 
if we trade $Z$ by the new $Z^\prime$ boson, the contribution to the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta a_{\mu}^{\gamma Z^\prime} = -\dfrac{g^2 g^2_{\ro{B-L}} m_\mu^2 \tan^2{\theta_W}}{1536 \pi^4} \left( g_{\ro{L}}^{ttZ^\prime} - g_{\ro{R}}^{ttZ^\prime} \right) \ro{T}_7\left( m_{Z^\prime}^2, m_t^2, m_t^2 \right)\,,
    \label{eq:agZ}
\end{equation}
where $T_7$ is a loop integral. % described in appendix \ref{app:T7}. 
%
The parameters $g_{\ro{L,R}}^{ttZ^\prime}$, calculated in \texttt{SARAH}, are the left- and right-chirality projections of the $Z^\prime$ coupling to top-quarks, given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    g_{\ro{L}}^{ttZ^\prime} &= -\dfrac{g_{\ro{B-L}}}{3} \cos{\theta_W^\prime} + \dfrac{g}{2} \cos{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime} - \dfrac{g_{\ro{Y}}}{6} \sin{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime} - \dfrac{g_{\ro{YB}}}{3} \sin{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime}\,,
    \\
    g_{\ro{R}}^{ttZ^\prime} &= -\dfrac{g_{\ro{B-L}}}{3} \cos{\theta_W^\prime} - \dfrac{2 g_{\ro{Y}}}{3} \sin{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime} - \dfrac{g_{\ro{YB}}}{3} \sin{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The loop integral $\ro{T}_7 \(m_{Z^\prime}^2, m_t^2, m_t^2\)$ was determined in Ref.~\cite{Feng:2009gn} and, in the limit $m_{Z^\prime} \gg m_t$, 
%as we show in Eq.~\eqref{eq:T7-expanded}, 
it can be shown to be simplifiable to, 
\begin{equation}
    \ro{T}_7 \(m_{Z^\prime}^2, m_t^2, m_t^2\) \simeq \frac{2}{m_{Z^\prime}^2} \,,
    \label{eq:T7}
\end{equation}
up to a small truncation error. %(see Appendix~\ref{app:T7} for details).
For the parameter space region under consideration the difference $g_{\ro{L}}^{ttZ^\prime} - g_{\ro{R}}^{ttZ^\prime}$ can be cast in a simplified form as follows 
\begin{equation}
    \left(g_{\ro{L}}^{ttZ^\prime} - g_{\ro{R}}^{ttZ^\prime}\right) \simeq \dfrac{\left(g^2+g_{\ro{Y}}^2\right)g_{\ro{YB}}}{32 g_{\ro{B-L}}} \left(\dfrac{v}{x}\right)^2\,.
    \label{eq:gLminusgR}
\end{equation}
Using this result and the approximate value of the loop factor, we can calculate the ratio between 
the two- and one-loop contributions to the muon $(g-2)_{\mu}$,
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{\Delta a_{\mu}^{\gamma Z^\prime}}{\Delta a_{\mu}^{Z^\prime}} \simeq -\dfrac{g^2 g_{\ro{Y}^2}}{2048 \pi^2} \dfrac{g_{\ro{YB}}}{g_{\ro{B-L}}} \left( \dfrac{v}{x} \right)^2 \ll 1\,,
\end{equation}
which shows that $\Delta a_\mu^{\gamma Z^\prime}$ does indeed play a subdominant role in our analysis and can be safely neglected. }
