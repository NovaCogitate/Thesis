\section{Fermion Masses, Yukawa Couplings and the CKM Matrix}

As referenced, given the charges of the fermion and lepton fields we cannot construct a gauge invariant theory with explicit mass terms for leptons. The mass of these particles will have to be generated by the Higgs Mechanism. This is easy to demonstrate as by returning to eq.\,\ref{eq:YukawaSM}, which is rewritten here, 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:YukawaSM2}
\mathcal{L}_{Yuk} = Y^u_{ij} \overline{Q_{L_i}} u_{R_j}  \tilde{H} + Y^d_{ij} \overline{Q_{L_i}}  d_{R_j} H  + Y^e_ij \overline{L_{L_i}}  e_{R_i} H + h.c. 
\end{equation}
%
Here we introduce the the yukawa matrices, $Y^{e,u,d}$, these are generic $3\times3$ complex coupling non-dimensional matrices, keeping $\tilde{H}$ as previously defined. Being the flavour indices, $i,j=\{ 1,2,3 \}$. By shifting the Higgs field $H$ as in Eq. (\ref{shame}),  \begin{comment}

\end{align}
}

proper expansion of these terms would result in terms, \textit{e.g.} in the electron's case,  
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{y} \supset \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, y^e_{diag} \; v \left( \overline{e_L} e_R + \overline{e_R} e_L \right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y^e_{diag} h(x) \left( \overline{e_L} e_R + \overline{e_R} e_L \right) \quad , 
\label{electron mass}
\end{equation}
%
This clearly translates to the first terms in (\ref{electron mass}) equating to a mass term, $m_e = \frac{y^e v}{\sqrt{2}} $, while the second terms represent interaction coupling between the electron and the Higgs boson.  
%
This is how the Higgs mechanism generates the mass to all of the fermionic and leptonic sector except neutrinos, due to the SM not containing right handed neutrinos.  % Now it is beneficial to write the mass terms as matricial form as,

{ \color{gray} The lack of a right handed neutrinos is very commonly addressed in most BSM scenarios. } 

\begin{comment}
Generically we can write the mass terms for all fermions as,
\begin{equation}
M^u_{ij} = Y^u_{ij} \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} \quad M^d_{ij} = Y^d_{ij} \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} \quad M^e_{ij} = Y^e_{ij} \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}
\end{comment}

The diagonalization of the Yukawa matrices is a simple eigenvalue problem, however note the Yukawa matrices remain arbitrary to some extent.
%
The Yukawa matrices contain some parameters that are not observable, and thus are not physical parameters, since they can be absorbed by redefinitions of the real fermion fields i.e. there are several combinations of $Y^{u,d}$ that return the same mass spectrum. 

Note that the increasing masses seen in each generation depend directly on the term hierarchy of the Yukawa terms. This means that the mass of all particles directly relate to how strongly they each interacts with the Higgs boson.

If you then take into account the real masses e.g. for the leptons, you'd note that the tau mass is in the GeV range while the electron's is in the 0.1 MeV range. These translate to very different couplings for each flavour. 

\subsubsection{Physical parameters}

The analysis of Quarks is a bit trickier and will require the introduction of the quark mixing trough the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. 

But before moving onto it, it is relevant to take a small detour to introduce what is a physical parameter. Physical parameters are parameters that cannot be rotated away by performing phase transformations or flavour rotations. For the example we introduced above in, Eq.\,\ref{electron mass}, the charged lepton yukawa matrix can always be made real and positive through a bi-unitarity transformation, as,
% 
\begin{equation}
Y_l \rightarrow U_L Y_l U_R = \hat{Y}_l = diag(y_e,y_\mu,y_\tau )
\end{equation}
%
To count the physical parameters of the Yukawa matrix, one starts by noting the initial parameters of $Y_l$, 9 real and 9 complex. Secondly in the unitary matrices you can find $2\times(3 \ \text{real} + 6 \ \text{im.} )$. Given their hermitian nature, you can rotate both unitarity matrices by a phase without any consequence, so we have 3 imaginary parameters without effect. To sum up, we have $9 - 2 \times 3 = 3 $ real and $ 9 - ( 2 \times 6 - 3 )$ imaginary physical parameters. The three real physical parameters are clearly the charged lepton masses. 

% If you try to count the physical parameters of the Yukawa matrix, you can see that initialy you have $Y_l$ with 9 real and 9 complex paramaters. And in the unitary matrices you can find $2\times(3 \ \text{real} + 6 \ \text{im.} )$.

%And seeing that if we rotate both unitarity matrices by a phase there is no change to the Yukawa values, so there are 3 imaginary parameters without effect. To sum up we have $9 - 2 \times 3 = 3 $ real and $ 9 - ( 2 \times 6 - 3 )$ imaginary physical paramaters. The three real physical parameters are the charged lepton masses, while there are no physical phases. 

{ \color{red}  Extrapolating from this exercise we can postulate the general rule on how to count the physical parameters
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:PhysicalParamaters}
\# \text{Physical Pars.} =  \# \text{Paramaters} - \# \text{Broken Symmetry Generators}
\end{equation}
I have no idea how to justify this.
}

\subsubsection{Quark Field redefinition}

Moving onto quarks, for the up and down quark Yukawa matrices, we will continue pursing a more general approach. The diagonalization of the Yukawa terms to achieve proper mass terms would generically be achieved through a bi-unitarity transformation, 

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
m^u_{diag.}  =  & \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} \mathrm{U}^u_L \mathrm{Y} {\mathrm{U}^u_R}^\dagger \nonumber \\ 
m^d_{diag.}  = & \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}  \mathrm{U}^d_L \mathrm{Y} {\mathrm{U}^d_R}^\dagger 
\end{split}
\end{align}

%We can now apply this principle, as seen in Eq.\,\ref{Eq:PhysicalParamaters} to count the physical parameters in the quark sector of the SM. Using the same unitary transformations, 

Naturally we can invert these equations such that, 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:YukawaBiUni}
\begin{split}
Y^u_{ij} = & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} (U_L^u m^u_{diag.} U_R^u)_{ij} \\
Y^d_{ij} = & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} (U_L^d m^d_{diag.} U_R^d)_{ij}
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
If we examine the effect this change had on the mass terms of quark fields, by replacing the result of eq.\,\ref{eq:YukawaBiUni} in eq\, \ref{eq:YukawaSM}.
%
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{L}_{Yuk} \supset -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} d_{L\,i} \, d_{R\,j} & - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} u_{L\,i} \, u_{R\,j} + h.c. \\ 
 & \Downarrow  \\
-(U_L^d m^d_{diag.} U_R^d)_{ij} d_{L\,i} \, d_{R\,j}  &- (U_L^u m^u_{diag.} U_R^u)_{ij} u_{L\,i} \, u_{R\,j} \\ 
& \Downarrow \\ 
-m^d_{diag.} d_{L\,i}^\prime \, d_{R\,j}^\prime & - m^u_{diag.} u_{L\,i}^\prime \, u_{R\,j}^\prime
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
where the primed fields are the quark fields in the mass basis, defined by our transformations as, 
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
d^\prime_{L,R} = U^d_{L,R} d_{L,R} \\
u^\prime_{L,R} = U^u_{L,R} u_{L,R} 
\end{split}  
\end{equation}
%
However this definition carries with it a problem, remember that while the left handed quark fields are $SU(2)_L$ doublets their right handed counter parts are not. So the coupling of the of fermions to their respective gauge fields changes, if we expand the up and down quark fields on the section of the Lagrangian,
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{L}_{ferm} \supset & 
\frac{1}{2} \overline{u^\prime_L} \gamma^\mu \left( g^\prime Y_L B_\mu + g W^0_\mu  \right) \left(U^u_L U^{u \dagger}_L \right) u^\prime_L - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} g \overline{u^\prime_L} \gamma^\mu \left( U^u_L U^{d \dagger}_L \right) d^\prime_L W^+_\mu \\ \nonumber   
- 
& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} g d^\prime_L \gamma^\mu \left( U^u_L U^{d \dagger}_L \right) u^\prime_L W^-_\mu 
+ 
\frac{1}{2} \overline{d^\prime_L} \gamma^\mu \left( g^\prime Y_L B_\mu - g W^0_\mu \right) \left( U^d_L U^{d \dagger}_L \right) d^\prime_L  
\end{split}
\end{align}
Through the use of the unitary property of these transform operators, $ \mathrm{U}^{u,d}_{L,R} \mathrm{U}^{u,d \dagger}_{L,R} = 1$, we can see that the interactions with the neutral bosons remain the same in the mass basis, however we can see that the charged currents are affected by this change. Therefor we define the the CKM matrix, as $V_{CKM} = U^u_L U^{u ^\dagger }_R $ and write the sensitive terms,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{FCNCs} \supset \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} g \overline{u}^\prime_L \gamma^\mu V_{CKM} d_L^\prime W^+_\mu + h.c. 
\end{equation}
This is in fact a very interesting feature of the Standard Model, by consequence of the $\mathrm{SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y }$ symmetry there are no interactions of the right handed unitary matrices and there for no mixing, coupling, or charged currents of right handed quarks, making them theoretically invisible to measurements.  

\subsubsection{excess from physical paramaters}

with the $V_CKM$ being the CKM. But how many entries of the CKM matrix are physical? If we use the principles introduced above we see that they are 9 real physical paramaters in the quark sector?

In conclusion, if the proper analysis is done you can find that the SM has a grand total of 19 physical parameters, 3 gauge couplings, 3 lepton masses, 6 quark masses, 4 parameters in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, 2 parameters in the Higgs sector (the Higgs mass and the strength of the self interaction), and the QCD $\theta$ parameter. 


%\subsection{Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix}

\begin{comment}

{ \color{red} I need to do more research on this chapter, I need to better explain why we don't have FCNCs at tree level. }  

%The interactions of quarks are defined from experimental results, so it is required that the SM can both explain the mass spectrum of quarks and the measured Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) matrix. The CKM matrix originates from messurements of charged flavour changing currents (FCNCs).

%From the lack of FCNCs observed (at non-perturbative orders) the diagonalization of both $M^{u,d}$ and $Y^{u,d}$ simultaneously should be possible. {{ \color{blue} The physical interpretation of this would naturally be that the gauge and mass basis are equal } and no off-diagonal interactions exist between generations of fermions. This diagonalization would generically be achieved through a bi-unitarity transformation, 

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
m^u_{diag.}  =  & \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} \mathrm{U}^u_L \mathrm{Y} {\mathrm{U}^u_R}^\dagger \nonumber \\ 
m^d_{diag.}  = & \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}  \mathrm{U}^d_L \mathrm{Y} {\mathrm{U}^d_R}^\dagger 
\end{split}
\end{align}

Naturally we can invert these equations such that, 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:YukawaBiUni}
\begin{split}
Y^u_{ij} = & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} (U_L^u m^u_{diag.} U_R^u)_{ij} \\
Y^d_{ij} = & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} (U_L^d m^d_{diag.} U_R^d)_{ij}
\end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\begin{split}

- 
& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} g d^\prime_L \gamma^\mu \left( U^u_L U^{d \dagger}_L \right) u^\prime_L W^-_\mu 
+ 
\frac{1}{2} \overline{d^\prime_L} \gamma^\mu \left( g^\prime Y_L B_\mu - g W^0_\mu \right) \left( U^d_L U^{d \dagger}_L \right) d^\prime_L

% PERGUNTAR Note also that the mass term for every lepton depends directly on each of the respective and different Yukawa term and that the SM is a theory where the Yukawa matrices are diagonal by nature not having inter generational terms. {\color{blue} Is it doe? what about FCNCs?}
