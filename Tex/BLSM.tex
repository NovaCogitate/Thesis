%\section{B-L-SM Model}
\chapter{B-L-SM Model} 

% Got this from the abstract in my BLSM paper 

Having discussed the Standard Model, we are ready to look at what might lie beyond it. In this chapter we introduce the minimal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model named, the B-L-SM Model. This is a model trough which we can explain neutrino mass generation via a simple see-saw mechanism as well as, by virtue of the model containing two new physical particle states, specifically a new Higgs like boson $H^\prime$ and a $Z^\prime$ gauge Boson, other small deviations in electro-weak measurements, namely the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly. This refers to the discrepancy between the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We try to examine how non-collider experiments could limit the study of new Models such as the B-L-SM.  

Both the additional bosons are given mass mostly trough the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry that gives it's name to the Model. This unitary group originates from the promotion of a accidental symmetry present in the SM, the Baryon number (B) minus the Lepton number (L) to a fundamental Abelian symmetry group. This origin for the mass of the referenced bosons means model is already very heavily constricted due to long-standing direct searches in the Large Hadron Collide (LHC). 

Trough this model we can also address the metastability of the electroweak (EW) vacuum in the SM trough the addition of the new scalar. Allowing for Higgs stabilization up to the plank scale with a the new Higgs starting from few hundred of GeVs. 

The presence of the complex SM-singlet field, $\chi$, interacting with a Higgs doublet typically enhances the strength of EW phase transition potentially converting it into a strong first-order one.
%
Although not covered in this work, the strength of this transition could be analysed to determine a possible gravitational wave spectrum. Such a analysis is of utmost importance given that it could provide a way to detect new physics and confirm or exclude the model without the need for a larger particle collider but instead a sensitive probe also capable of studying gravitational events. This could be pointed to as future work.

%One of the goals of this project was to investigate precisely the phenomenological status of the B-L-SM by confronting the new physics predictions with the LHC and electroweak precision data.   

The B-L-SM is also easily embedded into higher order symmetry groups like for example the $SO(10)$ or  or $E_6$ , giving this model the ability to be used for the study of Grand Unified Theories (GUT).  

The presence of three generations of right-handed neutrinos instead of a arbitrary number of neutrinos is purposely made, ensuring a framework free of anomalies. The mass scale of such neutrinos is established once the $U(1)_{B-L}$ is broken by the VEV, $x$, of a complex SM-singlet scalar field, $\chi$. This VEV simultaneously gives mass to the corresponding $Z^\prime$ boson and $H^\prime$.

The cosmological consequences of the B-L-SM formulation are also worth mentioning.  First, the presence of an extended neutrino sector implies the existence of a sterile state that can play the role of Dark Matter candidate. These can be completely sterile if stabilized with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity symmetry. Note that the existence of sterile neutrinos can be used to explain the baryon asymmetry via the leptogenesis mechanism. 

The goal of this chapter in our work is to present the fundamental theoretical background on the model and a modern precise study of the phenomenological status of the B-L-SM model. As well as trying to use multiple experiments to increasingly narrow down the available parameter space of the model.  

\subsection{Formulating the model}

Essentially, the minimal B-L-SM is a Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) framework containing three new ingredients: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item A new gauge interaction
  \item Three generations of right handed neutrinos  
  \item A complex scalar SM-singlet.
\end{itemize}

The first one is well motivated in various GUT scenarios. However a family-universal symmetry such as $U(1)_{B-L}$ being introduced without changing the SM fermion content would lead to chiral anomalies. This translates to a non conservative charged current on some channels involving the $U(1)_{B-L}$. These aren't completely undesired by themselves, since their result would be charge conjugation parity symmetry violation, but this inclusion would lead to processes at tree-level, thus resulting in far too much of these phenomena.

Secondly, as mentioned, a new sector of additional three $U(1)_{B-L}$ charged Majorana neutrinos is essential for anomaly cancellation. 

Finally, the SM-like Higgs doublet, $H$, does not carry neither baryon nor lepton number, this way it does not participate in the breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$. It is then necessary to introduce a new scalar singlet, $\chi$, solely charged under $U(1)_{B-L}$, whose VEV breaks the $B-L$ symmetry. It is also this breaking scale that generates masses for heavy neutrinos. As mentioned this breaking occurs before the EW breaking.

The particle content and related charges of the minimal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the SM are shown in the table. Note these are similar to the SM as to be expected.

\end{tabular}

\label{tab:charges}
\end{table} 

\subsubsection{Scalar sector}

Given the information seen above and the information we got in the previous chapter, we can begin examining the new Lagrangian terms. Starting by the scalar potential, which now depends on two fields as seen in, 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:potential}
V(H,\chi) = \mu_1^2 H^\dagger H + \mu_2^2 \chi^\ast \chi + \lambda_1 (H^\dagger H)^2 + \lambda_2 \left(\chi^\ast \chi\right)^2 + \lambda_3  \chi^\ast \chi H^\dagger H
\end{equation}
%
This potential must lead to stable vacuum state, for this to be ensured we state that the scalar potential must be bounded from below (BFB), ensuring a global minima.  Studying the potential on eq.\,\ref{eq:potential} we deduce the conditions,
\begin{equation}
4 \lambda_1 \lambda_2  -  \lambda_3^2 > 0 \quad , \quad \lambda_1 , \lambda_2>0 
\label{eq:BFB}
\end{equation}
%
Where the full components of the scalar fields $H$ and $\chi$ are given by,
\begin{equation}
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{pmatrix}
-i \( \omega_1 - i \omega_2 \) \\
v + (h + i z)
\end{pmatrix} \quad \chi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \( x + \(h^\prime + i z^\prime\) \)
\end{equation}
%
In these equations we can see $h$ and $h^\prime$ representing the radial quantum fluctuations around the minimum of the potential. These will constitute the physical degrees of freedom associated to the $H$ and $H^\prime$. There are also four Goldstone directions denoted as $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, $z$ and $z^\prime$ which are absorbed into longitudinal modes of the $W^\pm$, $Z$ and $Z^\prime$ gauge bosons once spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) takes place. After SSB the associated VEVs take the form, 
%
\begin{equation}
 \langle H \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
v 
\end{pmatrix}	
\qquad
 \langle  \chi \rangle  = \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}
\label{eq:vacuum}
\end{equation}
% 
here, recall $v$ and $x$ are the associated VEVs to each field. From here we can solve the tadpole equations in relation to each of the VEVs as to ensure non-zero minima, we arrive at,
%
\begin{equation}
	v^2 = \tfrac{-\lambda_2 \mu_1^2 + \tfrac{\lambda_3}{2}\mu_2^2}{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 - \tfrac{1}{4}\lambda_3^2} > 0
	\qquad
	\text{and}
	\qquad
	x^2 = \tfrac{-\lambda_1 \mu_2^2 + \tfrac{\lambda_3}{2}\mu_1^2}{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 - \tfrac{1}{4}\lambda_3^2} > 0 
	\label{eq:extremum}
\end{equation}
%
which, when simplified with the bound from bellow conditions yield a simpler set of equations,
%
\begin{equation}
\lambda_2 \mu_1^2 < \tfrac{\lambda_3}{2} \mu_2^2 
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
\lambda_1 \mu_2^2 < \tfrac{\lambda_3}{2} \mu_1^2
\label{eq:sols}
\end{equation}
%
Note that although $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ must be positive to ensure the correct potential shape, no such conditions exist for the sign of $\lambda_3$ , $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. However observing equation \ref{eq:sols} we can infer that some combinations of signs are impossible, 
%
\begin{table}[htb!]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|ccccc|}
			\hline  
			& $\mu_2^2 > 0$ & $\mu_2^2 > 0$ & $\mu_2^2 < 0$ & $\mu_2^2 < 0$  	\\
			& $\mu_1^2 > 0$ & $\mu_1^2 < 0$ & $\mu_1^2 > 0$ & $\mu_1^2 < 0$  	\\        
			\hline
			$\lambda_3 < 0 $     			    							& \xmark		& \checkmark	&	\checkmark & \checkmark	\\
			$\lambda_3 > 0$     			    							& \xmark		& \xmark	&	\xmark &  \checkmark \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular} 
		\caption{Possible Signs of the potential parameters in (\ref{eq:potential}). 
While the \checkmark\,symbol indicates the existence of solutions for tadpole conditions \eqref{eq:sols}, the \xmark\,indicates unstable configurations.}
		\label{tab:signs}  
	\end{center}
\end{table} 
%
For our studies we decided to leave the sign of $\lambda_3$ positive, choosing a configuration where both $\mu$ parameters are negative. This doesn't directly translate to any real physical consequence.  
%
These conditions now established we proceed to investigate the physical states of B-L-SM scalar sector. By first, taking the Hessian matrix evaluated at the vacuum value, 
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}^2 =
\begin{pmatrix}
4 \lambda_2 x^2 & \lambda_3 v x \\ 
\lambda_3 v x   & 4 \lambda_1 v^2 
\end{pmatrix}\,,
\label{eq:hess}
\end{equation}
% 
Moving this matrix to it's physical mass eigen-base, we obtain the following eigenvalues,
%
\begin{equation}
m_{h_{1,2}}^2 = \lambda_1 v^2 + \lambda_2 x^2 \mp \sqrt{(\lambda_1 v^2 - \lambda_2 x^2)^2 + (\lambda_3 x v)^2}\,,
\label{eq:eigvals}
\end{equation}
The physical basis vectors $h_1$ and $h_2$ can then be related to the original fields of gauge eigen-basis $h$ and $h^\prime$ trough a simple rotation matrix:
%
\begin{equation}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	h_1 \\
	h_2 
	\end{pmatrix}
	=
	\mathbf{O}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	h \\
	h^\prime 
	\end{pmatrix}\,.
	\label{eq:trans}
\end{equation}
%
Being that, the rotation matrix is written as, 
%
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{O} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	\cos \alpha_h & -\sin \alpha_h \\
	\sin \alpha_h & \cos \alpha_h 
	\end{pmatrix}\,.
	\label{eq:rotmat}
\end{equation}
%
Recall that due to the SSB order $x > v$. The precise mixing angle is represented simply by, 
\begin{equation}
\tan 2 \alpha_h   = \frac{ \left| \lambda_3 \right|  v v^\prime }{\lambda_1 v^2 - \lambda_2 v^{\prime\,^2} } 
\end{equation} 
Although consider it is worth presenting the case of approximate decoupling where, $v/x\ll 1$. In this case scalar masses and mixing angle become particularly simple,
\begin{equation}
\sin \alpha_h \approx \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\lambda_3}{\lambda_2} \dfrac{v}{x} \qquad
m_{h_1}^2 \approx 2 \lambda_1 v^2 \qquad m_{h_2}^2 \approx 2 \lambda_2 x^2
\label{eq:simplify}
\end{equation}
%
We will see in the context of our numerical results that for our phenomenologically consistent mass scale these equations serve a valid approximation for most of the  points.

\subsubsection{Gauge Sector}

Moving onto the gauge boson and Higgs kinetic terms in the B-L-SM, consider the following portion of the Lagrangian,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{U(1)'s} =  \left| D_\mu H \right|^2 + \left| D_\mu \chi \right|^2 -\dfrac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} -\dfrac{1}{4} F^\prime_{\mu \nu} F^{\prime \mu \nu} -\dfrac{1}{2} \kappa F_{\mu \nu} F^{\prime \mu \nu}
\label{eq:Lu1}
\end{equation}
where $F^{\mu \nu}$ and $F^{\prime \mu \nu}$ are the standard field strength tensors, respectively for the hypercharge $U(1)_{Y}$ and B minus L $U(1)_{B-L}$, 
\begin{equation}
	F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu 
	\qquad
	\text{and}
	\qquad
	 F^\prime_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A^\prime_\nu - \partial_\nu A^\prime_\mu\,.
	 \label{eq:Fmn}
\end{equation}
written in terms of the gauge fields $A_\mu$ and $A_\mu^\prime$, respectively. Given that this is a model with two Unitary groups, without a parity symmetry to prevent it, we must consider the possible mixing in between them. In this work we parametrized this mixing trough a parameter $\kappa$.

The Abelian part of the covariant derivative in equation \ref{eq:Lu1} is given by,
\begin{equation}
	D_\mu \supset i g_1 Y A_\mu + i g_1^\prime Y_{\rm B-L} A_\mu^\prime\,,
\end{equation} 
% 
with $g_1$ and $g_1^\prime$ being the $U(1)_{Y}$ and $U(1)_{B-L}$ the gauge couplings with the $Y$ and $B-L$ charges are specified in Tab.~\ref{tab:charges}. However it is convenient to rewrite the gauge kinetic terms in the canonical form, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
	F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} + F^\prime_{\mu \nu} F^{\prime \mu \nu} + 2 \kappa F_{\mu \nu} F^{\prime \mu \nu} \to B_{\mu \nu} B^{\mu \nu} + B^\prime_{\mu \nu} B^{\prime \mu \nu}\,.
	\label{eq:AtoB}
\end{equation}
%
A generic orthogonal transformation in the field space does not eliminate the kinetic mixing term. So, in order to satisfy Eq.~\eqref{eq:AtoB} an extra non-orthogonal transformation should be imposed such that Eq.~\eqref{eq:AtoB} is realized. Taking $\kappa = \sin \alpha$, a suitable redefinition of fields $\{A_\mu,A_\mu^\prime\}$ into $\{B_\mu, B_\mu^\prime\}$ that eliminates $\kappa$-term according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:Lu1} can be cast as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	A_\mu \\
	A^\prime_\mu 
	\end{pmatrix}
	=
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 & -\tan \alpha \\
	0 & \sec \alpha 
	\end{pmatrix}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	B_\mu \\
	B^\prime_\mu 
	\end{pmatrix}\,,
	\label{eq:trans-kappa}
\end{equation}
Note there is a limit without kinitic mixing where $\alpha = 0$. Note that this transformation is generic and valid for any basis in the field space. The transformation (\ref{eq:trans-kappa}) results in a modification of the covariant derivative that acquires two additional terms encoding the details of the kinetic mixing, i.e.

\begin{equation}
D_\mu \supset \partial_\mu + i \(g_Y \; Y + g_BY \; Y_{B-L}\) B_\mu + i \(g_{B-L} \; Y_{B-L} + g_{YB} \; Y\) B_\mu^\prime\,,
\label{eq:newCov}
\end{equation}	
where the gauge couplings take the form
\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
	g_Y = g_1 \\
	g_{B-L} = g_1^\prime \sec \alpha \\
	g_{YB} = -g_1 \tan \alpha \\
	g_{BY} = 0
	\end{cases} \,,
	\label{eq:new-g-simp}
\end{equation}
which is the standard convention in the literature. The resulting mixing between the neutral gauge fields including $Z^\prime$ can be represented as follows
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_\mu \\
Z_\mu \\
Z^\prime_\mu
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta_W & \sin \theta_W & 0\\
-\sin \theta_W \cos \theta_W^\prime & \cos \theta_W \cos \theta_W^\prime & \sin \theta_W^\prime \\
\sin \theta_W \sin \theta_W^\prime & -\cos \theta_W^\prime \sin \theta_W^\prime & \cos \theta_W^\prime
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
B_\mu \\
A^3_\mu \\
B^\prime_\mu
\end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:g-Z-Zp}
\end{equation}	
%
where $\theta_W$ is the weak mixing angle and $\theta^\prime_W$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\sin(2 \theta^\prime_W) = \frac{2 g_{YB} \sqrt{g^2 + g_{Y}^2}}{\sqrt{(g_{YB}^2 + 16 (\frac{x}{v})^2 g_{B-L}^2 - g^2 - g_{Y}^2)^2 + 4 g_{YB}^2 (g^2 + g_{Y}^2)} }\,,
\label{eq:theta-p-full}
\end{equation}
in terms of $g$ and $g_{Y}$ being the $SU(2)_{L}$ and $U_{Y}$ gauge couplings, respectively. In the physically relevant limit, $v/x \ll 1$, the above expression greatly simplifies leading to
\begin{equation}
	\sin \theta_W^\prime \approx \dfrac{1}{16
	} \dfrac{g_{YB}}{g_{B-L}}\( \dfrac{v}{x} \)^2 \sqrt{g^2 + g_{Y}^2} \,,
	\label{eq:theta-p}
\end{equation}
%
up to $(v/x)^3$ corrections. In the limit of no kinetic mixing, i.e. $g_{YB} \to 0$, there is no mixture of $Z^\prime$ and SM gauge bosons. 

Note, the kinetic mixing parameter $\theta_W^\prime$ has rather stringent constraints from $Z$ pole experiments both at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) and the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC), restricting its value to be smaller than $10^{-3}$ approximately, which we set as an upper bound in our numerical analysis. Expanding the kinetic terms $\left| D_\mu H \right|^2 + \left| D_\mu \chi \right|^2$ around the vacuum one can extract the following mass matrix for vector bosons
\begin{equation}
	m_V^2 =
	\dfrac{v^2}{4}
	\begin{pmatrix}
	g^2 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \\
	0 \;\;&\;\; g^2 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \\
	0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; g^2 \;\;&\;\; -g g_{Y} \;\;&\;\; -g g_{YB} \\
	0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; -g g_{Y} \;\;&\;\; g_{Y}^2 \;\;&\;\; g_{Y} g_{YB} \\
	0 \;\;&\;\; 0 \;\;&\;\; -g g_{YB} \;\;&\;\; g_{Y} g_{YB} \;\;&\;\; g_{YB}^2 + 16 \(\dfrac{x}{v}\)^2 g_{B-L}^2
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
%
whose eigenvalues read
\begin{equation}
	m_A = 0 \, \text{,} \qquad m_W = \tfrac{1}{2} v g
\end{equation}
corresponding to physical photon and $W^\pm$ bosons as well as
\begin{equation}
m_{Z,Z^\prime}=\sqrt{g^2 + g^2_{Y}} \cdot \frac{v}{2}  \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{g_{YB}^2 + 16 (\frac{x}{v})^2 g^2_{\rm BL} }{g^2 + g^2_{\rm Y}} +1  \right) \mp \frac{g_{YB}}{\sin(2 \theta_W^\prime) \sqrt{g^2 + g^2_{\rm Y}}}}\,.
\label{eq:ZZp-mass}
\end{equation}
for two neutral massive vector bosons, with one of them, not necessarily the lightest, representing the SM-like $Z$ boson. It follows from LEP and SLC constraints on $\theta_W^\prime$, that Eq.~\eqref{eq:theta-p} also implies that either $g_{YB}$ or the ratio $\tfrac{v}{x}$ are small. In this limit, Eq.~\eqref{eq:ZZp-mass} simplifies to
\begin{equation}
	m_Z \approx \tfrac{1}{2} v \sqrt{g^2 + g_{Y}^2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad m_{Z^\prime} \approx 2 g_{B-L} x\,,
	\label{eq:mZ}
\end{equation}
%
where the $m_{Z^\prime}$ depends only on the SM-singlet VEV ,$x$ and on the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge coupling and will be attributed to a heavy $Z^\prime$ state, while the light $Z$-boson mass corresponds to its SM value.

\subsection{The Yukawa sector}

One of the key features of the B-L-SM is the presence of non-zero neutrino masses. In its minimal version, such masses are generated via a type-I seesaw mechanism. The Yukawa Lagrangian of the model reads
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_f = 
-Y_u^{ij} \overline{q_{\rm L i}} u_{\rm R j} \widetilde{H} 
-Y_d^{ij} \overline{q_{\rm L i}} d_{\rm R j} H
-Y_e^{ij} \overline{\ell_{\rm L i}} e_{\rm R j} H
- Y_\nu^{ij} \overline{\ell_{\rm L i}} \nu_{\rm R j} \widetilde{H}
	-\dfrac{1}{2} Y_\chi^{ij} \overline{\nu_{\rm R i}^c} \nu_{\rm R j} \chi + {\rm c.c.}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:Yuk}
\end{equation}
Notice that Majorana neutrino mass terms of the form $M \overline{\nu_{R}^c} \nu_{R}$ would explicitly violate the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry and are therefore not present. In Eq.~\eqref{eq:Yuk}, $Y_u$, $Y_d$ and $Y_e$ are the $3 \times 3$ Yukawa matrices that reproduce the quark and charged lepton sector of the SM, while $Y_\nu$ and $Y_\chi$ are the new Yukawa matrices responsible for the generation of neutrino masses and mixing. In particular, one can write
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{m}_{\nu_l}^{Type-I} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\dfrac{v^2}{x} \mathbf{Y}_\nu^t \mathbf{Y}^{-1}_\chi \mathbf{Y}_\nu\,,
\end{equation}
%
for light $\nu_l$ neutrino masses, whereas the heavy $\nu_h$ ones are given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{m}_{\nu_h}^{Type-I} \approx \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{Y}_\chi x\,,
\end{equation} 
where we have assumed a flavour diagonal basis. Note that the smallness of light neutrino masses imply that either the $x$ VEV is very large or (if we fix it to be at the $\mathcal{O}\left({TeV}\right)$ scale and $\mathbf{Y}_\chi \sim \mathcal{O}\(1\right)$) the corresponding Yukawa coupling should be tiny, $\mathbf{Y}_\nu < 10^{-6}$. It is clear that the low scale character of the type-I seesaw mechanism in the minimal B-L-SM is \textit{faked} by small Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson. A more elegant description was proposed in Ref.~\cite{Khalil:2010iu} where small SM neutrino masses naturally result from an inverse seesaw mechanism. In this work, however, we will not study the neutrino sector and thus, for an improved efficiency of our numerical analysis of $Z^\prime$ observables, it will be sufficient to fix the Yukawa couplings to $\mathbf{Y}_\chi = 10^{-1}$ and $\mathbf{Y}_\nu = 10^{-7}$ values such that the three lightest neutrinos lie in the sub-eV domain.

%\subsubsection{Neutrino masses}

%As mentioned briefly during the course of this dissertation the SM suffers from lacking a way to explain the observed neutrino masses by default. The minimal way of addressing this problem is by adding heavy Majorana type neutrinos in order to realise a seesaw mechanism. In this chapter we hope to explain how by perform the addition we could generate light neutrino states and how this addition is justified as part of a larger theory.

\subsection{Phenomenological analysis}


The numerical results that will be presented in this section were created trough the first generation of a tool developed during the course of this thesis.

The created tool was based on a series of bash and python scripts that would generate a Monte-Carlo type scan trough all the parameter space within the desired orders of magnitude. All points were sequentially checked against the most resent modern constraints stemming from several experiments like the LHC. 


So after the generation of a set of couplings and physical constants the very first layer of phenomenological checks is done by \texttt{SPheno} which promptly rejects any scenario with tachyonic scalar masses and un-renormalizable quantities.  

\texttt{SPheno} is a particle spectrum generator code written in Fortran 90. It's emphasis on easy generalisability and speed made it a natural part of our phenomenological analysis. It accepts information about our model's Lagrangian, such as fields, charges and fundamental symmetries, and creates a executable file capable of quickly generating a spectrum file with all details regarding mass, decay and flavour observables information in the standardized SUSY Les Houches accord format. 

The Lagrangian information is fed to \texttt{SPheno} also in standardized format automatically generated by a Mathematica packaged designed for such purposes called \texttt{SARAH}. 

After a point completes the first layer, we take information from it's two and three body decays in particular to the Higgs bosons and perform the first test of the Higgs Sector by running a set of Programs called \texttt{HiggsBounds} and \texttt{HiggsSignals}. These test experimental detection limits for the new scalars and verify if we have a "SM" like Higgs to account for the detected boson. 

However the presence of new bosons in the theory can lead to large deviations in EW precision observables. Typically, the most stringent constraints of the scalar sector emerge from the oblique $S,T,U$ parameters, which are also calculated by \texttt{SPheno}. Current precision measurements provide the allowed regions,
\begin{equation}
	S = 0.02 \pm 0.10\,, \qquad T = 0.07 \pm 0.12\,, \qquad U = 0.00 \pm 0.09
	\label{eq:oblique}
\end{equation}
%
where $S$-$T$ are $92\%$ correlated, while $S$-$U$ and $T$-$U$ are $-66\%$ and $-86\%$ anti-correlated, respectively. We compare our results with the EW fit in Eq.~\eqref{eq:oblique} and require consistency with the best fit point within a $95\%$ C.L.~ellipsoid (see Ref.~\cite{Costa:2014qga} for further details about this method). We show in Fig.~\ref{fig:STU} our results in the $ST$ (left) and $TU$ (right) planes where black points are consistent with EW precision observables at $95\%$ C.L.~whereas grey ones lie outside the corresponding ellipsoid of the best fit point and, thus, are excluded in our analysis.

%The B-L-SM predicts a new visible scalar, which we denote as $h_2$, in addition to a SM-like $125~\ro{GeV}$ Higgs boson, $h_1$. 

Thus, in a second layer of phenomenological tests, we confront the surviving scenarios, black points in Fig.~\ref{fig:STU}, with collider bounds. In particular, we use \texttt{HiggsBounds 4.3.1} \cite{Bechtle:2013wla} to apply $95\%$ C.L.~exclusion limits on a new scalar particle, $h_2$, and \texttt{HiggsSignals 1.4.0} \cite{Bechtle:2013xfa} to check for consistency with the observed Higgs boson taking into account all known Higgs signal data. For the latter, we have accepted points whose fit to the data replicates the observed signal at $95\%$ C.L.~while the measured value for its mass, $m_{h_1} = 125.10 \pm 0.14~\textrm{GeV}$ \cite{Tanabashi:2018oca}, is reproduced within a $3\sigma$ uncertainty. The required input data for \texttt{HiggsBounds/HiggsSignals} are generated by the \texttt{SPheno} output in the format of a SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA) \cite{Skands:2003cj} file. In particular, it provides scalar masses, total decay widths, Higgs decay branching ratios as well as the SM-normalized effective Higgs couplings to fermions and bosons squared (that are needed for analysis of the Higgs boson production cross sections). For details about this calculation, see Ref.~\cite{Bechtle:2013wla}.
 
On a third layer of phenomenological tests we have studied the viability of the surviving scenarios from the perspective of direct collider searches for a new $Z^\prime$ gauge boson. We have used \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO 2.6.2} \cite{Alwall:2014hca} to compute the $Z^\prime$ Drell-Yan production cross section and subsequent decay into the first and second-generation leptons, i.e.~$ \sigma \left( pp \to Z^\prime \right) \times B \left( Z^\prime \to \ell \ell\right)$ with $\ell = e,\; \mu$, and then compared our results to the most recent ATLAS exclusion bounds from the LHC runs at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13~\textrm{TeV}$ \cite{Aaboud:2017buh}. The \texttt{SPheno} SLHA output files were used as parameter cards for \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, where the information required to calculate $ \sigma\left(pp \to Z^\prime\right) \times B\left(Z^\prime \to \ell \ell\right()$, such as the $Z^\prime$ boson mass, its total width and decay branching ratios into lepton pairs, is provided. 


The lepton anomalous magnetic moments $\left( g-2 \right)_\ell /2 \equiv a_\ell$ are calculated in \texttt{SPheno} at one-loop order. In the B-L-SM, new physics (NP) contributions to $a_\mu$, denoted as $\Delta a_\mu^{\textrm{NP}}$ in what follows, can emerge from the diagrams containing $Z^\prime$ or $h_2$ propagators. In this article, we study whether the muon anomalous magnetic moment can be totally or partially explained in the model under consideration and all scenarios with an excessive contribution to $\Delta a_\mu^{\textrm{NP}}$ larger than the upper $2 \sigma$ bound in Eq.~(\ref{g-2}) were rejected.


\subsection{Discussion of numerical results}
\label{sec:discuss}


Let us now discuss the phenomenological properties of the B-L-SM model. First, we focus on the current collider constraints and study their impact on both the scalar and gauge sectors.

Coloured points have survived all theoretical and experimental constraints while grey points are excluded by direct $Z^\prime$ searches at the LHC.

We show in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} the scenarios generated in our parameter space scan (see Tab.~\ref{tab:scan}) that have passed all theoretical constraints such as boundedness from below, unitarity and EW precision tests, are compatible with the SM Higgs data and where a new visible scalar $h_2$ is unconstrained by the direct collider searches. On the left panel, we show the $Z^\prime$ production cross section times its branching ratio to the first- and second-generation leptons, $\sigma B \equiv \sigma \left( pp \to Z^\prime \right) \times B \left( Z^\prime \to \ell \ell \right) $ with $\ell = e,\mu$, as a function of the new vector boson mass and the new physics contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $\Delta a^{\textrm{NP}}_\mu$ (colour scale). On the right panel, we show the new scalar mass as a function of the same observables. All points above the red dashed line are excluded at $95\%$ C.L.~by the upper expected limit on $Z^\prime$ direct searches at the LHC by the ATLAS experiment and are represented in grey shades. Darker shades denote \textit{would-be-scenarios} with larger values of $\Delta a^{\textrm{NP}}_\mu$ while the smaller contributions to the muon $\left(g-2\right)_\mu / 2$ anomaly are represented with the lighter shades. The region between the two dashed lines corresponds to the $Z^\prime$ ATLAS limit with a $2\sigma$ uncertainty represented by the yellow band in Fig.~4 of \cite{Aaboud:2017buh}. Provided that the observed limit by the ATLAS detector lies within this region we have taken a conservative approach and accepted all points whose $\sigma B$ value lies below the red dashed line (upper limit) in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1}. The blue dashed line, which corresponds to the stricter $2 \sigma$ lower bound, is only shown for completeness of information. The red cross in our figures signals the lightest $Z^\prime$ found in our scan which we regard as a possible early-discovery (or early-exclusion) benchmark point in the forthcoming LHC runs. Such a benchmark point is shown in the first line of Tab.~\ref{tab:bench}. On the right panel, we notice that the new scalar bosons can become as light as $380 - 400~\textrm{GeV}$, but with $Z^\prime$ masses in the range of $5 - 9~\textrm{TeV}$. We highlight with a magenta diamond the benchmark point with the lightest $Z^\prime$ boson within this range. This point is shown in the second line of Tab.~\ref{tab:bench}.

\subsubsection{Implications of direct $Z^\prime$ searches at the LHC for the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly}

Looking again to Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} (left panel), we see that there is a thin dark-red stripe where $\Delta a^{\ro{NP}}_\mu$ explains the observed anomaly shown in Eq.~(\ref{g-2}) for a range of $m_{Z^\prime}$ boson masses approximately between $5~\ro{TeV}$ and $20~\ro{TeV}$. This region is particularly interesting as it can be partially probed by the forthcoming LHC runs or at future colliders. If a $Z^\prime$ boson discovery remains elusive for such a mass range, it can exclude a possibility of explaining the muon $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ anomaly in the context of the B-L-SM. It is also worth noticing that such preferred $\Delta a^{\ro{NP}}_\mu$ values represent a small island in the right plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} where the new scalar boson mass is restricted to the range of $1~\ro{TeV} < m_{h_2} < 4~\ro{TeV}$.

New physics contributions $\Delta a_\mu^{\ro{NP}}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment are given at one-loop order by the Feynman diagrams depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:g-2}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{/BLSM/g-2.pdf}
	\caption{One-loop diagrams contributing to $\Delta a_\mu^{\ro{NP}}$ in the B-L-SM.}
	\label{fig:g-2}
\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Since the couplings of a new scalar $h_2$ to the SM fermions are suppressed by a factor of $\sin \alpha_h$, which we find to be always smaller than $0.08$ as can be seen in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4}, the right diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:g-2}, which scales as $\Delta a_\mu^{h_2} \propto \tfrac{m_\mu^2}{m_{h_2}^2}\left(y_\mu \sin \alpha_h\right)^2$ with $\sin^2 \alpha_h < 0.0064$ and $y_\mu = Y_e^{22}$, provides sub-leading contributions to $\Delta a_{\mu}$. Furthermore, as we show in the top-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4} the new scalar boson mass, which we have found to satisfy $m_{h_2} \gtrsim 380~\ro{GeV}$, is not light enough to compensate the smallness of the scalar mixing angle. Conversely, and recalling that all fermions in the B-L-SM transform non-trivially under $\U{B-L}$, the new $Z^\prime$ boson can have sizeable couplings to fermions via gauge interactions proportional to $g_{\rm B-L}$. Therefore, the left diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:g-2} provides the leading contribution to the $\left(g-2\right)_\mu$ in the model under consideration.

	\label{fig:Plots4}
\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In particular, $\Delta a_\mu^{Z^\prime}$ is given by \cite{Freitas:2014pua}
\begin{equation}
\Delta a_\mu^{Z^\prime} = \tfrac{1}{12 \pi^2} \tfrac{m_{\mu}^2}{m_{Z^\prime}^2} \(3 g_{\rm L}^{\mu \mu Z^\prime} g_{\rm R}^{\mu \mu Z^\prime} - {g_{\rm L}^{\mu \mu Z^\prime}}^2 - {g_{\rm R}^{\mu \mu Z^\prime}}^2 \)
\label{eq:ZpContribution}
\end{equation}
where the left- and right-chiral projections of the charged lepton couplings to the $Z^\prime$ boson, $g_{\rm L}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime}$ and $g_{\rm R}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime}$, respectively, can be approximated as follows
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    g_{\rm L}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime} &\simeq g_{\rm B-L} + \tfrac{1}{32} \(\tfrac{v}{x}\)^2 \tfrac{g_{\rm YB}}{g_{\rm B-L}} \[g_{\rm Y}^2 - g^2 + 2 g_{\rm Y}g_{\rm YB}\]\,,
    \\
    g_{\rm R}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime} &\simeq g_{\rm B-L} + \tfrac{1}{16} \(\tfrac{v}{x}\)^2 \tfrac{g_{\rm YB}}{g_{\rm B-L}} \[g_{\rm Y}^2 + g_{\rm Y}g_{\rm YB}\]\,,
\end{aligned}\label{eq:gllZ}
\end{equation}
to the second order in $v/x$-expansion. If $v/x \ll 1$, corresponding to the darker shades of the color scale in the top-right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4}, we can further approximate
%
\begin{equation}
    g_{\rm L}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime} \simeq g_{\rm R}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime} \simeq g_{\ro{B-L}}\,,
    \label{eq:gLgR-simp}
\end{equation}
%
such that the muon anomalous magnetic moment gets significantly simplified to
\begin{equation}
\Delta a_\mu^{Z^\prime} \simeq \dfrac{g_{\ro{B-L}}^2}{12 \pi^2} \dfrac{m_{\mu}^2}{m_{Z^\prime}^2}\,.
\label{eq:amu-simple}
\end{equation}
%
Similarly, for the yellow band, which corresponds to the region where $\Delta a_{\mu}^{\rm NP}$ is maximized (see top-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1}), a large value of the $\U{B-L}$ gauge coupling also allows one to simplify Eq.~\eqref{eq:ZpContribution} reducing it to the form of Eq.~\eqref{eq:amu-simple}. This is in fact what we have observed and, for the yellow band region, we see in the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3} that $g_{\ro{B-L}} \simeq 3$. A sizeable value of $g_{\ro{B-L}}$ is indeed what is contributing to the enhancement of $\Delta a_{\mu}^{\rm NP}$, in particular, for the red region in both panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1}. We show in the third and fourth lines of Tab.~\ref{tab:bench} the two benchmark points that better reproduce the muon anomalous magnetic moment represented by two black dots in
Figs.~\ref{fig:Plots1}, \ref{fig:Plots4} to \ref{fig:Plots2}.

	\label{fig:Plots3}
\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In fact, a close inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} (left panel) and Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4} (top-right panel) reveals an almost one-to-one correspondence between the colour shades. 
This suggests that $\Delta a_{\mu}^{Z^\prime}$ must somehow be related to the VEV ratio $v/x$. 
To understand this behaviour, let us also look to Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3} (top-right panel) where we see that the kinetic-mixing gauge coupling $g_{\ro{YB}}$ is typically very small apart from two green bands where it can become of order $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
Interestingly, whenever $g_{\ro{YB}}$ becomes sizeable, $v/x \ll 1$ is realised, which means that Eq.~\eqref{eq:mZ} is indeed a good approximation as was argued above. It is then possible to eliminate $g_{\ro{B-L}}$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:amu-simple} and rewrite it as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta a_\mu^{Z^\prime} \simeq \dfrac{y_\mu^2}{96 \pi^2} \(\dfrac{v}{x}\)^2 \,,
    \label{eq:amu-vev}
\end{equation}
which explains the observed correlation between both Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots1} (left panel) and Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4} (top-right panel) and, for instance, the thin red stripe of points compatible with a full description of the muon $\left(g-2\right)_{\mu}/2$ anomaly. Note that this simple and illuminating relation becomes valid as a consequence of the heavy $Z^\prime$ mass regime, in combination with the smallness of the $\theta_{W}^{\prime}$ mixing angle required by LEP constraints. Indeed, while we have not imposed any strong restriction on the input parameters of our scan (see Tab.~\ref{tab:scan}), Eq.~\eqref{eq:theta-p} necessarily implies that both $g_{\ro{YB}}$ and $v/x$ cannot be simultaneously sizeable in agreement with what is seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3} (top-left panel) and Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4} (top-right panel). The values of $\theta_W^\prime$ obtained in our scan are shown in the top-right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3}.

For completeness, we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots2} the physical couplings of $Z^\prime$ to muons (top panels) and to $W^\pm$ bosons (bottom panel).

\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Note that, for the considered scenarios, the latter can be written as
\begin{equation}
    g^{WWZ^\prime} \simeq \dfrac{1}{16} \dfrac{g_{\ro{YB}}}{g_{\ro{B-L}}} \(\dfrac{v}{x}\)^2\,.
    \label{eq:gWWZp}
\end{equation}
While both $g_{\ro{B-L}}$ and the ratio $v/x$ provide a smooth continuous contribution in the $\sigma B - m_{Z^\prime}$ projection of the parameter space, the observed blurry region in $g^{WWZ^\prime}$ is correlated with the one in the top-left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3} as expected from Eq.~\eqref{eq:gWWZp}. On the other hand, the couplings to leptons $g_{\rm L,R}^{\ell \ell Z^\prime}$ exhibit a strong correlation with $g_{\ro{B-L}}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots3}, in agreement with our discussion above and with Eq.~\eqref{eq:gLgR-simp}.

\subsubsection{Barr-Zee type contributions}
\label{sec:BarrZee}

To conclude our analysis, one should note that the two-loop Barr-Zee type diagrams \cite{Barr:1990vd} are always sub-dominant in our case. To see this, let us consider the four diagrams shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Barr-Zee}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{/BLSM/Barr-Zee.pdf}
	\caption{Barr-Zee type two-loop diagrams contributing to $\Delta a_\mu$.}
	\label{fig:Barr-Zee}
\end{figure}	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The same reason that suppresses the one-loop $h_2$ contribution in Fig.~\ref{fig:g-2} is also responsible for the suppression of both the top-right and bottom-right diagrams in Fig.~\ref{fig:Barr-Zee} (for details see e.g.~Ref.~\cite{Ilisie:2015tra}). Recall that the coupling of $h_2$ to the SM particles is proportional to the scalar mixing angle $\alpha_h$, which is always small (or very small) as we can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:Plots4}. An analogous effect is present in the diagram involving a $W$-loop, where a vertex proportional to $g^{WWZ^\prime}$ suppresses such a contribution. The only diagram that might play a sizeable role is the top-left one where the couplings of $Z^\prime$ to both muons and top quarks are not negligible.

Let us then estimate the size of the first diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:Barr-Zee}. This type of diagrams were already calculated in Ref.~\cite{Feng:2009gn} but for the case of a SM $Z$-boson. Since the same topology holds for the considered case of B-L-SM too, 
if we trade $Z$ by the new $Z^\prime$ boson, the contribution to the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta a_{\mu}^{\gamma Z^\prime} = -\dfrac{g^2 g^2_{\ro{B-L}} m_\mu^2 \tan^2{\theta_W}}{1536 \pi^4} \left( g_{\ro{L}}^{ttZ^\prime} - g_{\ro{R}}^{ttZ^\prime} \right) \ro{T}_7\left( m_{Z^\prime}^2, m_t^2, m_t^2 \right)\,,
    \label{eq:agZ}
\end{equation}
where $g_{\ro{L,R}}^{ttZ^\prime}$, calculated in \texttt{SARAH}, are the left- and right-chirality projections of the $Z^\prime$ coupling to top-quarks, given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    g_{\ro{L}}^{ttZ^\prime} &= -\dfrac{g_{\ro{B-L}}}{3} \cos{\theta_W^\prime} + \dfrac{g}{2} \cos{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime} - \dfrac{g_{\ro{Y}}}{6} \sin{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime} - \dfrac{g_{\ro{YB}}}{3} \sin{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime}\,,
    \\
    g_{\ro{R}}^{ttZ^\prime} &= -\dfrac{g_{\ro{B-L}}}{3} \cos{\theta_W^\prime} - \dfrac{2 g_{\ro{Y}}}{3} \sin{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime} - \dfrac{g_{\ro{YB}}}{3} \sin{\theta_W} \sin{\theta_W^\prime}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The loop integral $\ro{T}_7 \(m_{Z^\prime}^2, m_t^2, m_t^2\)$ was determined in Ref.~\cite{Feng:2009gn} and, in the limit $m_{Z^\prime} \gg m_t$, as we show in Eq.~\eqref{eq:T7-expanded}, it gets simplified to
\begin{equation}
    \ro{T}_7 \(m_{Z^\prime}^2, m_t^2, m_t^2\) \simeq \frac{2}{m_{Z^\prime}^2} \,,
    \label{eq:T7}
\end{equation}
up to a small truncation error (see Appendix~\ref{app:T7} for details). For the parameter space region under consideration the difference $g_{\ro{L}}^{ttZ^\prime} - g_{\ro{R}}^{ttZ^\prime}$ can be cast in a simplified form as follows 
\begin{equation}
    \left(g_{\ro{L}}^{ttZ^\prime} - g_{\ro{R}}^{ttZ^\prime}\right) \simeq \dfrac{\left(g^2+g_{\ro{Y}}^2\right)g_{\ro{YB}}}{32 g_{\ro{B-L}}} \left(\dfrac{v}{x}\right)^2\,.
    \label{eq:gLminusgR}
\end{equation}
Using this result and the approximate value of the loop factor, we can calculate the ratio between 
the two- and one-loop contributions to the muon $(g-2)_{\mu}$,
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{\Delta a_{\mu}^{\gamma Z^\prime}}{\Delta a_{\mu}^{Z^\prime}} \simeq -\dfrac{g^2 g_{\ro{Y}^2}}{2048 \pi^2} \dfrac{g_{\ro{YB}}}{g_{\ro{B-L}}} \left( \dfrac{v}{x} \right)^2 \ll 1\,,
\end{equation}
which shows that $\Delta a_\mu^{\gamma Z^\prime}$ does indeed play a subdominant role in our analysis and can be safely neglected.


\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

To summarise, in this work we have performed a detailed phenomenological analysis of the
minimal $\U{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model known as the B-L-SM. In particular, 
we have confronted the model with the most recent experimental bounds from the direct 
$Z^\prime$ boson and next-to-lightest Higgs state searches at the LHC. Simultaneously, 
we have analysed the prospects of the B-L-SM for a consistent explanation 
of the observed anomaly in the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)_{\mu}$. 
For this purpose, we have explored the B-L-SM potential for interpretation of the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly in the regions of the model parameter space that 
are consistent with direct searches and electroweak precision observables.

As one of the main results of our analysis, we have found phenomenologically consistent model parameter space regions that simultaneously fit the exclusion limits from direct $Z^\prime$ searches and can explain the muon $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly. In particular, we have identified four benchmark points for future phenomenological exploration -- the first one with the lightest $Z^\prime$ ($m_{Z^\prime}>3.1$ TeV), the second -- with the lightest second scalar boson ($m_{h_2}>400$ GeV), and the other two points that reproduce the muon $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly within $1\sigma$ uncertainty range. Besides, we have studied the correlations of the $Z^\prime$ production cross section times the branching ratio into a pair of light leptons versus the physical parameters of the model. In particular, we have found that the muon $(g-2)_{\mu}$ observable dominated by $Z^\prime$ loop contributions lies within the phenomenologically viable parameter space domain. For completeness, we have also estimated the dominant contribution from the Barr-Zee type two-loop corrections and found a relatively small effect.
