\chapter{3HDM}

We have studied the main features and the phenomenological  consistency of a family non-universal Three Higgs Doublet Model or 3HDM with a softly broken $\mathrm{U(1)\times Z_2} $ symmetry group. This broken symmetry will justify the flavour hierarchies in the SM and trough a Branco-Grimus-Lavoura mechanism supress the otherwise expected Flavour Changing Neutral Currents. 

Let us now consider an extended version of the SM, with an enlarged Higgs sector that contains three generations of scalar-doublets. These Higgs will be named $\phi^i$ with $i={1,2,3}$.  In this sector we must enforce the alignment limit to the scalar sector ensuring the physical scalar spectrum accommodates a SM-like Higgs boson with mass of $125.09$ GeV.
