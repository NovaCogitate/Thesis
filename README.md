# Final Thesis in Physical Engineering

Hello. This was my final work for my master's in Physical Engineering at the Univeristy of Aveiro. 

Although my degree was supposed to be focused mainly on solid state, simulation and electronics, I decided to do my thesis on particle phsycis to cover all my basis and become what I thought would be a well rounded engineer. I also geniounly found particle physics and quantum field theory although challenging, engaging.  

Perhaps I was not thinking clearly at the time and not thinking 5 years ahead... The only thing this thesis contributed in the long run to my life was giving me extensive coding and physical simulation skills and two scientific journal publications. 

Please peer at your hearts content but there is little to no coding here. This work was made possible by [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/en/) funding and the support of my friends and family.
